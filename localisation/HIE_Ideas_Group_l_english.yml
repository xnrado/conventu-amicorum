 HIE_COLONIAL_BRI_ideas_bonus: "British-Colonial Ambition"
 hie_colonial_bri_pilgrims: "The Pilgrim Fathers"
 hie_colonial_bri_pilgrims_desc: "Initial English settlers were called Pilgrims, journeying across the atlantic to escape religious persecution at home. After several years living in exile in Holland, they eventually determined to establish a new settlement in the New World and arranged with investors to fund them.  The Pilgrims' story became a central theme in the history and culture of the United States."
 hie_colonial_bri_lord_proprietors: "Lord Proprietors"
 hie_colonial_bri_lord_proprietors_desc: "Royal charters were given to establish colonies as a way of both confirming legitimacy and claims to the ruling of a piece of land. These charters were held by Lord Proprietors. Each proprietary colony had a unique system of governance reflecting the geographic challenges of the area as well as the personality of the lord proprietor. The colonies of Maryland and New York, based on English law and administration practices, were run effectively. However, other colonies such as Carolina were mismanaged. The colonies of West and East Jersey as well as Pennsylvania were distinct in their diversion from the traditional monarchial system that ruled most colonies of the time."
 hie_colonial_bri_free_press: "Freedom of the Press"
 hie_colonial_bri_free_press_desc: "Early printers played a significant role in the development of American culture. Colonial law and news did not have the resources for comprehensive print forms for the common colonist and information was scarce. Printing and publishing initially arose as a form of religious enthusiasm and the need for bibles and other religious literature. When the British Crown began imposing new taxes, many of these newspapers became highly critical and outspoken about the British colonial government, which was widely considered unfair among the colonists."
 hie_colonial_bri_salutary_neglect: "Salutary Neglect"
 hie_colonial_bri_salutary_neglect_desc: "The Crown had little interest in enforcing parliamentary laws in its colonies, and thus they had degrees of autonomy that allowed them to thrive undisturbed. The policy succeeded in increasing money flow from the colonies to Britain. The lack of enforcement of trading laws meant American merchants profited from illegal trading with French possessions in the Caribbean, which Britain prospered from in turn as American merchants purchased more British goods."
 hie_colonial_bri_great_awakening: "The Great Awakening"
 hie_colonial_bri_great_awakening_desc: "The First Great Awakening began in the 1730s and lasted to about 1740, though pockets of revivalism had occurred in years prior, especially amongst the ministry of Solomon Stoddard, Jonathan Edwards' grandfather.Edwards' congregation was involved in a revival later called the "Frontier Revivals" in the mid-1730s, though this was on the wane by 1737. The evangelical movement of the 1740s played a key role in the development of democratic thought as well as the belief of the free press and the belief that information should be shared and completely unbiased and uncontrolled."
 hie_colonial_bri_heart_of_empire: "Heart of the Empire"
 hie_colonial_bri_heart_of_empire_desc: "The British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from British North America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items. By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the gross domestic product of the British Empire."
 hie_colonial_bri_rights_of_englishmen: "Rights of Englishmen"
 hie_colonial_bri_rights_of_englishmen_desc: "The rights of the colonists are infrangible and no higher power nor crown can violate them!"

 HIE_COLONIAL_DUT_ideas: "Dutch-Colonial Ideas"
 HIE_COLONIAL_DUT_ideas_start: "Dutch-Colonial Traditions"
 HIE_COLONIAL_DUT_ideas_bonus: "Dutch-Colonial Ambition"
 hie_colonial_dut_private_companies: "Geprivatise Handelscompagnieën"
 hie_colonial_dut_private_companies_desc: "The Dutch empire was almost entirely run by chartered companies, with the dominant two being the West and East India Companies. Particularly the GWC focused on the Americas and the triangle trade. The majority of the Dutch colonial empire's overseas holdings consisted of coastal forts, factories, and port settlements with varying degrees of incorporation of their hinterlands and surrounding regions. Dutch chartered companies often dictated that their possessions be kept as confined as possible in order to avoid unnecessary expense."
 hie_colonial_dut_factories: "Factorijen"
 hie_colonial_dut_factories_desc: "Dutch colonies operated on a similar level to Portuguese factories, since their colonies consisted of mainly trading posts. Brazil and New Amsterdamn were the only places were colonisation included a focus on expansion, compared to their many concessions in the Indian Ocean."
 hie_colonial_dut_patroon_system: "Patroon System"
 hie_colonial_dut_patroon_system_desc: "Patroons were landholders who were given incentives to colonise and settle. The deeded tracts were called patroonships and could span 16 miles in length on one side of a major river, or 8 miles if spanning both sides. In 1640, the charter was revised to cut new plot sizes in half, and to allow any Dutch American in good standing to purchase an estate. The title of patroon came with powerful rights and privileges. A patroon could create civil and criminal courts, appoint local officials and hold land in perpetuity. In return, he was required by the Dutch West India Company to establish a settlement of at least 50 families within four years on the land, or ship fifty colonists to it within four year. As tenants working for the patroon, these first settlers were relieved of the duty of public taxes for ten years, but were required to pay rent to the patroon. A patroonship sometimes had its own village and other infrastructure, including churches."
 hie_colonial_dut_liberalised_markets: "Liberalised Markets"
 hie_colonial_dut_liberalised_markets_desc: "Dutch Corporate spirit manifested itself in their colonies as well, with some functioning as independent nations. Both the GWC and VOC traded in stocks and utilised private navies and armies to conquer and settle."
 hie_colonial_dut_grand_design: "Groot Desseyn"
 hie_colonial_dut_grand_design_desc: "The Netherlands isn't the only colonial power in the new world, and many others hungrily look at our posessions. Plans must be drawn up to strike first in the event of a European war."
 hie_colonial_dut_free_men: "Vrijboeren"
 hie_colonial_dut_free_men_desc: "The new world presents opportunity for many feudal subjects who yearn for freedom. By presenting the colony as an enticing land, to escape from the hardships of continental life, the colony will be bolstered by thousands of settlers, hoping for a free life."
 hie_colonial_dut_civil_liberties: "Burgerlijke Vrijheden"
 hie_colonial_dut_civil_liberties_desc: "The coastal cities foster new thoughts, ones where the rights of men are enshrined and that colonists are more than simple tax-farmers. Dutch spirits of civil liberties emmigrate their way to the colonies, where they will foster and grow."

 HIE_COLONIAL_LAT_ideas_bonus: "Latin-Colonial Ambition"
 hie_colonial_lat_national_militia: "Milizia Nazionale"
 hie_colonial_lat_national_militia_desc: "The need for expansion outside the municipal border required the creation of specialized bodies for the protection and territorial expansion in the ever-growing period of venture companies in the panorama of Italian particularism. In order to try to counter the expansionism of the other Italian powers and find salvation in front of the foreign mercenaries hired by this or that prince, various specialized bodies were created in every Italian municipality paid directly by the nation itself."
 hie_colonial_lat_renaissance: "Echi del Rinascimento"
 hie_colonial_lat_renaissance_desc: "A first crisis of the Florentine Renaissance would occur after the death of Lorenzo the Magnificent (1492) and the seizure of power by Girolamo Savonarola, who however, if on the one hand established a theocratic republic aimed at striking at the most pagan and lustful aspects of the Renaissance, on the other hand triggered a process of rethinking and renewal of the religious tradition, destined to last well beyond his execution at the stake in 1498."
 hie_colonial_lat_missions: "Missio a Gentes"
 hie_colonial_lat_missions_desc: "Our goal, the purpose of all our sacrifices is not the quest to be holy, to be right with God, but His Glory. The Glory of the Eucharist. This is what drives us to "meet" the human being wherever he or she may be, and it is this desire to see Jesus better known and better loved that drives us across the ocean, to listen to and serve the poorest, those in need of affection, "of a word of love that conquers, transforms and uplifts"."
 hie_colonial_lat_republican_traditions: "Tradizioni Republicane"
 hie_colonial_lat_republican_traditions_desc: "In Europe, republicanism was revived in the late Middle Ages when a number of states, which arose from medieval communes, embraced a republican system of government. These were generally small but wealthy trading states in which the merchant class had risen to prominence. Haakonssen notes that by the Renaissance, Europe was divided, such that those states controlled by a landed elite were monarchies, and those controlled by a commercial elite were republics. The latter included the Italian city-states of Florence, Genoa, and Venice and members of the Hanseatic League."
 hie_colonial_lat_coastal_expeditions: "Spedizioni Costiere"
 hie_colonial_lat_coastal_expeditions_desc: "From the start of time the Italian explorers and merchants have lead expeditions at the merce of foreign rulers like the portuguese, the Vivaldi brothers ventured south of the Pillars of Hercules in 1291 and never returned, Lanzerotto Malocello discovered the Canary Islands (c. 1310-1339), Antonio de Noli discovered the Cape Verde Islands (1460-1462) and Antonio Malfante was the first to cross the Sahara in the 15th century."
 hie_colonial_lat_commercial_concessions: "Concessioni Commerciali"
 hie_colonial_lat_commercial_concessions_desc: "The period immediately following the first crusades was characterised by a strong increase in domestic and international trade. The Mediterranean was the main crossroads for trade between East and West and vice versa. The four Maritime Republics of Genoa, Venice, Pisa and Amalfi were the protagonists of these exchanges. In the same basin, the maritime cities of southern France and Catalonia also operated successfully, with Marseilles and Barcelona being particularly active. The ports of the eastern Mediterranean were the arrival point for goods from the Silk Road, which ran from China through Central Asia and Persia to Asia Minor and Syria."
 hie_colonial_lat_new_world_navy: "Marinai del Nuovo Mondo"
 hie_colonial_lat_new_world_navy_desc: "The skill of the Italian shipbuilders created a long lasting tradition in the Maritime Republic which gave them the upper hand in the trade and sea superiority in the Mediterranean, obviously while there will always be only one Venetian Arsenal, the skill have been passed down alongside the knowledge and the rule, such as the rules of Gazaria, the creation of a Magistrato delle Galilee to emualate the finest latin ships in the new world."

 HIE_COLONIAL_POR_ideas: "Portuguese-Colonial Ideas"

 HIE_COLONIAL_POR_ideas_bonus: "Portuguese-Colonial Ambition"
 hie_colonial_por_pau_brazil: "Pau Brazil"
 hie_colonial_por_pau_brazil_desc: "Pau Brazil is an extremely valuable commodity and is highly valued in Europe. It just so happens that Brazil is abundant with the wood. When Portuguese navigators landed in present-day Brazil, on April 22, 1500, they immediately saw that brazilwood was extremely abundant along the coast and in its hinterland, along the rivers. In a few years, a hectic and very profitable operation for felling and shipping all the brazilwood logs they could get was established, as a crown-granted Portuguese monopoly."
 hie_colonial_por_entradas: "Entradas"
 hie_colonial_por_entradas_desc: "An Entrada is an armed expedition into the Brazilian wilderness in search of indigenous slaves, gold, or trade. In the Northeast, entradas sought native slaves for sugar plantations and domestic service in the sixteenth century. In Amazonia they pursued slaves, nuts, spices, wood, and herbal drugs in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. In southern Brazil entradas forcibly relocated thousands of indigenous people to Portuguese towns in the seventeenth century and searched for gold in the eighteenth century. These long expeditions charted much of the Brazilian west and led to the discoveries of gold, emeralds, and diamonds in the interior."
 hie_colonial_por_bandeirantes: "Bandeirantes"
 hie_colonial_por_bandeirantes_desc: "The Flag Carriers of Brazil are largely responsible for Portuguese expansion into Brazil. Though they originally aimed to capture and enslave Indians, the bandeirantes later began to focus their expeditions on finding gold, silver, and diamond mines. As they ventured into unmapped regions in search of profit and adventure, they expanded the effective borders of the Brazilian colony."
 hie_colonial_por_estrada_real: "Estrada Real"
 hie_colonial_por_estrada_real_desc: "Portugal maintained a large and extensive network of Royal Roads throughout its colonies, which helped to ensure the flow of goods and movement of troops. Transportation along the road was tightly controlled by agents of the crown to prevent smuggling and unauthorized movement. Goods were transported in mule trains known as tropas, led by tropeiros, mule drivers. Products from Portugal made their way up the road while minerals made their way to the coast, as manufacturing and many crops were prohibited by the crown so as to keep the region economically dependent on Portugal. Many of Brazil's hearty dishes, such as feijão tropeiro and tutu, were originally prepared by the tropeiros, who needed food that could be transported without spoiling."
 hie_colonial_por_caboclo: "Caboclo"
 hie_colonial_por_caboclo_desc: "Similar to the Mestizo, a Caboclo is a person with mixed European and Amerindian ancestry. Brazil continues to have a number of these people and represent the multiculturalism that fosters itself in the colony."
 hie_colonial_por_capoeira: "Capoeira"
 hie_colonial_por_capoeira_desc: "Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance,acrobatics, and music. It was practiced by enslaved Africans in Brazil at the beginning of the 16th century. It is known for its acrobatic and complex maneuvers, often involving hands on the ground and inverted kicks. It emphasizes flowing movements rather than fixed stances; the ginga, a rocking step, is usually the focal point of the technique. Several groups of enslaved persons who liberated themselves gathered and established settlements, known as quilombos, in remote and hard-to-reach places would develop this martial art. Some quilombos would soon increase in size, attracting more fugitive slaves, Brazilian natives and even Europeans escaping the law or Christian extremism. Some quilombos would grow to an enormous size, becoming a real independent multi-ethnic state."
 hie_colonial_por_gold_rush: "Corrida do Ouro"
 hie_colonial_por_gold_rush_desc: "Gold is being discovered and hundreds of thousands flock to the areas. Minais Gerai and Ouro Preto have become hubs of mining. Our Bandeirantes will lead the way forward and claim all the gold for Portugal!"

 HIE_COLONIAL_SPA_ideas: "Spanish-Colonial Ideas"
 HIE_COLONIAL_SPA_ideas_start: "Spanish-Colonial Traditions"
 HIE_COLONIAL_SPA_ideas_bonus: "Spanish-Colonial Ambition"
 hie_colonial_spa_indian_reductions: "Reducciones de Indios"
 hie_colonial_spa_indian_reductions_desc: "Indian reductions were aimed at the natives for a number of reasons, but the most common reasons were to Christianize, tax, and govern them to comply with Spanish customs and economic interests. Starting in the Carribean, Spanish policies began to be implemented elsewhere in the new world and the Phillipines, which was accelerated by the loosening grip Spain had on its Andean subjects. Spain thus sought to aggrandize its power by consolidating viceregal rule and reviving the flow of Andean silver to the metropolitan treasury. This meant the forced resettlement and assimilation of over 1 million Andeans."
 hie_colonial_spa_manilla_galleon: "Galeón de Manila"
 hie_colonial_spa_manilla_galleon_desc: "Manila Galleons linked New Spain with the Phillipines for over 2 centuries, and represented the height of Spanish naval dominance. Most of the ships were built in the Phillipines itself. The Spanish inaugurated the Manila galleon trade route in 1565 after Andrés de Urdaneta pioneered the tornaviaje from the Philippines to Mexico, with the route lasting until Mexico's independence."
 hie_colonial_spa_repartimiento: "Repartimiento"
 hie_colonial_spa_repartimiento_desc: "The Repartimiento was instated to substitute the Encomienda system that had come to be seen as abusive and promoting of unethical behavior. The Spanish Crown aimed to remove control of the indigenous population, now considered subjects of the Crown, from the hands of the encomenderos, who had become a politically influential and wealthy class, with the shift away from both the encomienda system and the enslavement of the native groups. Repartmientos were not slavery and workers were “free”, but conditions in certain mines like Potosi were hauntingly similar to plantations seen in the Carribean."
 hie_colonial_spa_purity_of_blood: "Limpieza de Sangre"
 hie_colonial_spa_purity_of_blood_desc: "Despite debates over race and nationality being more of a modern concept, the Spanish empire did operate on a leve of racial purity, aimed at reducing the influence of Muslims and Jews within the colonies. Shortly after the Spanish colonization of the Americas was initiated, several regulations were enacted in the Laws of the Indies to prevent Jews and Muslims and their descendants from emigrating to and settling in the overseas colonies. Within the colonies, the idea of purity also applied to the indigenous. Candidates for office and their spouses had to obtain a certificate of purity that proved that they had no Jewish or Muslim ancestors and in New Spain, proof of whiteness and absence of any in the lineage who had engaged in work with their hands."
 hie_colonial_spa_real_audencia: "Reales Audiencia y Virreinatos"
 hie_colonial_spa_real_audencia_desc: "Audiencias originated in mainland Spain, being implemented in Valladolid and Ciudad Real. With the discovery and subsequent conquests of the New World, Castile introduced the audiencia to its new territories as part of its campaign to bring the area and its Spanish settlers and conquerors under royal control. It soon became clear that the audiencia system would not be sufficient to effectively run the overseas government. Viceroys were therefore introduced and audiencias were given a consultative and quasi-legislative role in the administration of the territories. Both viceroys and audiencias were ultimately overseen by a Council of the Indies. Unlike their peninsular counterparts, the overseas audiencias had legislative and executive functions in addition to their judicial ones, and thus represented the king in his role as maker of laws and dispenser of justice"
 hie_colonial_spa_creole_militia: "Creole Militia"
 hie_colonial_spa_creole_militia_desc: "As Spain held a tigh grip on its colonies, their defence was also a Spanish burden, until conflicts at home turned Spanish attention increasingly towards the mainland and the colonies had to fend for themselves to an extent. Militarily, they aimed to strengthen the coastal fortifications, increasing the size of local garrisons by raising more colonial troops, and to rotate units between Spain and its colonies on a regular basis. The military reforms in themselves did not alter social relationships, but since the military buildup in Spain proper limited the means available for colonial defense, the reformers decided to arm the colonial population. Hence, a disciplined and organized permanent militia was created. Although mainly consisting of criollos, it was still considered new and dangerous to arm any others than peninsulares. The lack of suitable criollo recruits in some areas led the Spanish military authorities to organize militia units of pardos and morenos."
 hie_colonial_spa_presidio: "Presidio"
 hie_colonial_spa_presidio_desc: "The Spanish used presidios to expand their influence throughout their empire, and were centers of Arnis, a martial art in the Phillipines. In the Mediterranean and the Philippines, the presidios were outposts of Christian defense against Islamic raids. In the Americas, the fortresses were built to protect against raid of pirates, rival colonists, as well as Native Americans."
