 # Events:

 besseres_hrr_incident_golden_bull_events.EVTDESC1: "The Emperor, [Root.Monarch.GetName], had the idea of enacting an empire wide \"basic law\". This \"Golden Bull\" could improve the legal situation in the empire as well as finally regulate the elections on the base of a written law."
 besseres_hrr_incident_golden_bull_events1.EVTOPT1: "But what will the princes say?"

 besseres_hrr_incident_golden_bull_events.EVTNAME2: "Proclamation of the \"Golden Bull\""
 besseres_hrr_incident_golden_bull_events.EVTDESC2: "The Golden Bull is an Imperial Code. From 1356 it was the most important \"basic law\" of the Holy Roman Empire. It regulated the circumstances of the election of the kings and emperors in the HRE by the prince-electors til the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. \n\nThe Golden Bull of 1356 was a decree issued by the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg and Metz (Diet of Metz (1356/57)) headed by the Emperor Charles IV which fixed, for a period of more than four hundred years, important aspects of the constitutional structure of the Holy Roman Empire. It was named the Golden Bull for the golden seal it carried. \n\nOnly the prince-electors had the right to elect the Holy Roman king. The Golden Bull introduced the plurality voting system. Now the king needed the majority of  prince-electors to vote for him, instead of all. \nThe territory of the prince-electors were declared to be indivisible, to prevent having to split or increase the amount of electorships. The real goal of the Golden Bull was to prevent the rising of anti-kings. This was finally achieved."
