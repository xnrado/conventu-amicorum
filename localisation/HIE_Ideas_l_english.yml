 hie_crt_every_port_shipyard_desc: "our island is a strategic center in the eastern Mediterranean and the Venetians recognized it as such.

 hie_crt_ports_chandia_heraklion_desc: "Our western and our eastern capitals respectively. Both were important harbors even before the Venetians came.

 hie_epi_western_orthodox_church_desc: "I can hear you say “who?' but let me explain. Catastrophe struck in 1054 when the Patriarch of Rome betrayed the Roman church and led his flock astray. Not all of his former flock followed so blindly, however. While we stayed true to the Roman orthodox church, we had no place to go. The Catholics hate us and see us as heretics, the Orthodox see us as betrayers and Catholics, and we were abandoned by our patriarch, our church, and our fellow Christians.

Given our current situation these Roman laws are more practical but the majority Gothic population still primarily adheres to our ancient Gothic codes. For our convenience it might be time that we combine both."
 hie_feo_princesses_theodoro: "The Princesses of Theodoro"
 hie_feo_princesses_theodoro_desc: "The marriage strategies of the Gothic kingdom were never built on the idea of gaining more land nor titles, they were focused on the gaining of friendly relations and allies.

Mehmed, the Conqueror took Constantinople, and made it the capital with the name of Istanbul, then with their full force turned against Hungary. In 1456 the Turkish troops sieged Nándorfehérvár, the key fortress of the Hungarian defense belt. The Sultan could not overcome the defenders, and Hunyadi's rescuing army inflicted a stunning defeat on Mehmed in his own camp. Hunyadi deeply believed in the importance of the battle fought for the Christian Europe against the Ottoman Empire, and in that the outcome of this is crucial for the future of our Motherland. As many times in history, so during the Nándorfehérvár battle lasting for three-weeks, Hungary defended not only herself, but the whole of Europe, and the Christian world: the unexpected and shining victory stopped the Turks' further expansion in Europe for almost seventy years."

He placed two cavalry brigades in the middle. He divided the infantry armies among them. In the first row he watched the heavy-armed, in the second the spearmen, archers, in the third group the tried and tested veteran reserve army, waiting for the signal and order calling for the final fight.

This law called articuli, was an attempt at a systematic codification of statute law. As it repeats a significant amount of previous legislation, it stands for tradition. As it contained changes or expansions of these older decisions in many points, it may be seen as an example for renewal. A major innovation was, however, that it was the first law of the kingdom of Hungary published in print."

Some already existed, but most were transcribed by Matthias Corvinus himself, who used Italian miniaturists such as Attavante Attavanti, Gherardo di Giovanni di Miniato or Francesco d'Antonio del Chierico, as well as founding his own school in the Hungarian capital."

At first we would absorb them into our own order but it became clear that not all our ideals aligned, so we had to adapt. Over time we have become more an aggregation of orders then just the Knights Hospitallers, one could say a coalition of knights."

 hie_kni_fortification_experts_desc: "We have been building and defending forts ever since our conception in the Holy Land: fortresses like Krak de Chevaliers, Kerak, and Montreal. Our real test, however, was when we were put in control of the defense of Smyrna against Timur. We held strong until they blockaded us and undermined us but we held for as long as we could. This experience has helped us to perfect our fortifications and has taught us what and what not to do during sieges."

 hie_moe_despotate_mystras_desc: "Despots was the title given to the heir apparent of the throne of Rome. After the Fourth crusade and the reconquest of the duchy of Achaea, which we renamed Mystras in Greek, or Morea in Latin. It became the home and the duchy of the heir apparent, meaning that only if they had this title could they be considered heir to the Roman throne."
 hie_moe_palaelogan_renaissance: "The Palaeologan Renaissance"
 hie_moe_palaelogan_renaissance_desc: "Also known as the second Byzantine renaissance, with the first being the Macedonian one. The Palaeologan was unlike the Macedonian one, which was focused on ancient Rome, by instead seeking a return to Justinian's Byzantium. Its main focus lay on regaining the homeland, restructuring the army, and initiating another golden age for Roman innovation and the Roman church."

 hie_moe_establishing_allagia: "Establishing the Allagia"
 hie_moe_establishing_allagia_desc: "These combat units are a product of the Palaeologan renaissance. These combat units used a lot less manpower, were easier to train and specialize and when used correctly were highly effective in both open combat and hit-and-run techniques. They would synergize really well with the still-in-use heavy knights of the empire, the cataphracts."

 hie_moe_reestablishment_themata_pronoia_desc: "These two systems were essential for the Byzantine government after its resurrection and the defeat of the Latin empire. The Themata system would divide the country into provinces to apply Roman law in an efficient manner. The Pronoia system on the other hand was a system that applied a tax to the population and with the money of said tax they could field and maintain their professional armies. This tax would come from taxing the sale of certain trade goods and crafts, this would mostly apply to goods and crafts of luxurie, like the silk, wine and wax we produce or on the making of jewelry and raiment."

Only during the Venetian rule did colonization begin which we resisted hard, although the already catholic islands were open to it and have a lot of Italian heritage now. Now that we have liberated ourselves from their wretched dominion and suppression we have to look beyond this. Catholic or orthodox, Greek or Latin, it does not matter: we are children of the Aegean. We stand together now in the defense of our home."

 hie_tur_timarli_sipahi: "Timarli Sipahi"
 hie_tur_timarli_sipahi_desc: "Initially deployed by the Seljuks, Sipahi constitute much of the Ottoman cavalry, divided between the Timariots and the Kapikulu. While the sipahi form their own distinctive social classes, and are often in rivalry with the Janissaries, their skills as cavalrymen make them a show of force on the battlefield. Utilising the Timar system, Timariots are granted a fief of land directly by the Ottoman sultan or with his official permission by beylerbeys. They are entitled to all of the income from that land, in return for military service. The peasants on the land are subsequently attached thereto, granting the Timariots similar status to contemporary knights. In wartime, Timarli sipahis and their retainers were gathered under their alay-beys. The equipment and tactics differ between the Anatolian and Balkan Timarli Sipahi. The Anatolian Sipahi were equipped and fought as classic horse archers, shooting while galloping, yet they weren't nomadic cavalry and their status was similar to medium cavalry class. Balkan Timarli Sipahis wore chainmail, rode barded horses and carried lances and javelins, and fought as medium cavalry."
 hie_tur_slaves_of_sublime_porte: "Kapikulu Ocagi"
 hie_tur_slaves_of_sublime_porte_desc: "The Janissaries. Two notable institutions created by the Ottoman sultans were the military organization of the Janissaries and the civil service. These institutions evolved from the practice by the Ottoman leaders in Anatolia of employing captured prisoners as mercenary troops. Later on, during the conquest of the Balkans, the Turks, with the religious sanction of the grand mufti, took as tribute from the Christian population a percentage of the male children. These became the 'slaves of the sultan'. Completely severed from their Christian families, these children were brought up as Muslims and imbued with religious devotion to Islam and loyalty to the sultan. The more able were enrolled in the palace corps of pages and trained to become administrators and officials into the Sublime Porte. The remainder were given a military education and became members of the Janissary corps, one of the best trained and most effective soldiers in Europe."
 hie_tur_osmans_dream: "Osman's Dream"
 hie_tur_osmans_dream_desc: "Osman saw himself and his host reposing near each other. From the bosom of Edebali rose the full moon and inclining towards the bosom of Osman it sank upon it, and was lost to sight. After that a goodly tree sprang forth, which grew in beauty and in strength, ever greater and greater. Still did the embracing verdure of its boughs and branches cast an ampler and an ampler shade, until they canopied the extreme horizon of the three parts of the world. Under the tree stood four mountains, which he knew to be Caucasus, Atlas, Taurus, and Haemus. These mountains were the four columns that seemed to support the dome of the foliage of the sacred tree with which the earth was now centered. From the roots of the tree gushed forth four rivers, the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Danube, and the Nile. Tall ships and barks innumerable were on the waters. The fields were heavy with harvest. The mountain sides were clothed with forests. Thence in exulting and fertilizing abundance sprang fountains and rivulets that gurgled through thickets of the cypress and the rose. In the valleys glittered stately cities, with domes and cupolas, with pyramids and obelisks, with minarets and towers. The Crescent shone on their summits: from their galleries sounded the Muezzin's call to prayer. That sound was mingled with the sweet voices of a thousand nightingales, and with the prattling of countless parrots of every hue. Every kind of singing bird was there. The winged multitude warbled and flitted around beneath the fresh living roof of the interlacing branches of the all-overarching tree; and every leaf of that tree was in shape like unto a scimitar. Suddenly there arose a mighty wind, and turned the points of the sword-leaves towards the various cities of the world, but especially towards Constantinople. That city, placed at the junction of two seas and two continents, seemed like a diamond set between two sapphires and two emeralds, to form the most precious stone in a ring of universal empire. Osman thought that he was in the act of placing that visional ring on his finger, when he awoke."
 hie_tur_imperial_council: "Divan-I Hümayun"
 hie_tur_imperial_council_desc: "Serving as the de facto cabinet, the Imperial Council was one of two arms of government in the Ottoman Empire. The empire was uniquely separated between state and provincial administration, with the military and executive seeing separation to keep the empire streamlined. By the 16th century, the council met regularly, 4 times per week, and the Sultan often headed discussions. Although many decisions were taken outside the formal context of the Imperial Council, it was the main executive body of the Empire, conducting all kinds of tasks of government such as the conduct of foreign relations, including the reception of foreign ambassadors, the preparation of campaigns, the construction of fortifications and public buildings, the reception of reports from the provincial governors and the appointments to state office, as well as continuing to function as a court of law, particularly for members of the military class."
 hie_tur_indian_ocean_expeditions: "Hint Seferleri"
 hie_tur_indian_ocean_expeditions_desc: "After the voyages of Vasco da Gama, a powerful Portuguese navy took control of the Indian Ocean in the early 16th century. It threatened the coastal cities of the Arabian Peninsula and India. The headquarters of the Portuguese navy was in Goa, a city on the west coast of India, in 1510. Ottoman control of the Red Sea meanwhile began in 1517 when Selim I annexed Egypt to the Ottoman Empire after the Battle of Ridaniya. Most of the habitable zone of the Arabian Peninsula soon fell voluntarily to the Ottomans. Selim entered into negotiations with Sultan Muzaffar II of Gujarat, about a possible joint strike against the Portuguese in Goa, which would be officially ratified following a joint Mamlukean-Gujarat-Calicut naval coalition that the Sultan aided in, even though the Battle of Diu was a major loss. The naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean were only partially successful. The original goals of checking Portuguese domination in the ocean and assisting a Muslim Indian lord were, naturally enough, not achieved. On the other hand, Yemen, as well as the west bank of the Red Sea, roughly corresponding to a narrow coastal strip of Sudan and Eritrea, were annexed by Özdemir Pasha, the deputy of Hadim Suleiman Pasha. Three more provinces in East Africa were established in Massawa, Habesh and Sawakin. The ports around the Arabian Peninsula were also secured. Ottoman assistance to Aceh in 1569 is also considered to be a part of these expeditions. However, that expedition was not a military expedition."
 hie_tur_bombardiers: "Humbaraci"
 hie_tur_bombardiers_desc: "The Ottomans were keen adopters of firearms in the 15th century, drawing on traditions of archery and rapid conquests. Bronze bombards enabled the Ottomans to conquer Constantinople, and expertise in the field of firearms crushed the crusade at varna. However, a new unit was created, one that gave the firepower of artillery to mobile infantry. The bombardiers were created as a detachment of other infantry corps, and was the first of its kind, representing the innovations in firearms that the Ottomans had been pioneering for 2 centuries."
 hie_tur_advice_for_the_king: "Nasihatname"
 hie_tur_advice_for_the_king_desc: "Literary works of this nature were written to address the struggles which the state was experiencing, and to advise the ruler on how to properly solve them. Advice writers frequently alluded to the reign of Sultan Suleiman I as the ideal model which contemporary rulers should seek to emulate. Writers who portrayed the empire as being in decline from a previous golden age were often motivated to do so by class or factional interests, as they often came from or were influenced by groups who had been disenfranchised by the empire's reforms, such as the timariots, or otherwise felt personal indignation toward the state as a result of failing to achieve career advancement, indicating a clear bias in their writings."

 hie_eng_common_law: "Common Law"
 hie_eng_common_law_desc: "A vestige of England's Saxon roots, the common law, unlike Roman law traditions on the mainland, is a collection of traditions and decisions overtime, much of them embodied in general principles rather than written down. While often inflexible and cumbersome, it has proved a durable and effective institution for keeping England remarkably stable over the centuries."
 hie_eng_royal_navy: "The Royal Navy"
 hie_eng_royal_navy_desc: "England's geographic position on the preeminent island of Europe has many challenges that only naval innovations could solve. From the first navy commissioned by Alfred the Great to ward off Viking incursions, to the Elizabethan reforms manning the Channel, the only protection England had from stronger continental powers, England's identity has owed itself in large part to protection by sea. The Royal Navy was thus the largest and proudest of Europe's many powerful navies for centuries."
 hie_eng_acts_union: "Acts of Union"
 hie_eng_acts_union_desc: "The English, and later British, national identity were forged by the linking of various nations, cultures, languages, and traditions together. The English language alone is a remarkable amalgamation of Latin, Frankish, Norse, and Germanic influences. The history of England from Alfred the Great's union of the Anglo-Saxon realms into a common Angleland, down through the attempted union with France and the eventual union with Scotland followed this trend. Finally, this tradition culminated in the Acts of Union. Starting with the abolishment of centuries of laws reflecting hostility between two nations, it then rebranded the kingdom title to better suit the nations' new identity, resolved trade disputes, granted special status to local customs, and guaranteed the freedom of the local state church. In all, it followed the English custom of creating a mutually beneficial union, making the process much smoother than for most attempts at unification."
 hie_eng_acts_concerning_regulation_trade: "Acts Concerning the Regulation of Trade"
 hie_eng_acts_concerning_regulation_trade_desc: "From the Navigation Acts to the later Stamp Acts, the heavy involvement of the institution of Parliament in trade, due in large part to the self-interests of its members, meant the trade laws were codified in great detail in England before in most other countries, allowing them to become one of the most dominant trading powers in world history."
 hie_eng_new_model_army: "New Model Army"
 hie_eng_new_model_army_desc: "After the Hundred Years' War and the defeat of and union with Scotland, England for decades allowed its army to decay, as its navy protected it from any serious threat. As modern weaponry advanced, however, England was forced to play catch up as it remained on a largely medieval model in an early modern context. To this end, prominent military leaders successfully advocated for comprehensive army reform, establishing a uniform, professional, and disciplined elite which was the envy of Europe at the time, around which a more modernized army in general could be built."
 hie_eng_admiralty: "The Admiralty"
 hie_eng_admiralty_desc: "The unusually vital importance of naval power to England's success meant that England spent far more of it's state revenues on navy than other states and the army and navy often competed for available resources and manpower. To solve this, the English Crown created the Secretary of the Admiralty, which devoted a fixed set of resources and taxes to maintaining a professional modern navy at a time when many nations still relied on drafted merchant ships and privateers."
 hie_eng_empiricism: "Empiricism"
 hie_eng_empiricism_desc: "Referring to a larger trend in education, the royal court, and other elites that took root in England, Empiricism largely rejects the use of abstract philosophy and thought to uncover truth. Instead, it holds that the only way to learn truth is to observe, notate, and test the world as we and observe it through our senses. This philosophy, if it could be called such, provided a cradle for some of the best scientific minds in Europe, from Francis Bacon to Newton and beyond."

This ringing cry for freedom unites the Scottish people to fight to the death for our homeland, and would serve as an inspiration for centuries to come, including the American Declaration of Independence."
 hie_sco_schiltron: "Schiltron"
 hie_sco_schiltron_desc: "In contrast to the long Swiss pikes and the short, heavy goedendags of Flanders, the Scots pioneered a medium spear formation that is adept at melee both with cavalry and against other infantry opponents. This also allows for the classic Highland charge as a tactic, since the men are unencumbered by more ponderous weaponry."
 hie_sco_universal_literacy: "Universal Literacy"
 hie_sco_universal_literacy_desc: "Known as the “Scottish miracle,' a concerted effort by both church and state in the 16th century made Scotland the first place in human history where the entire adult population could read and write.

From Novgorod's northeastern lands ("The Lands Beyond the Portages" as they were called in the chronicles), the area stretching north of Lakes Ladoga and Onega up to the White Sea and east to the Ural Mountains had so much fur that medieval travel accounts tell of furry animals raining from the sky. The Novgorodian merchants traded with Swedish, German, and Danish cities. In early years, the Novgorodians sailed the Baltic themselves (several incidents involving Novgorodian merchants in Gotland and Denmark are reported in the Novgorodian First Chronicle). Orthodox churches for Novgorodian merchants have been excavated on Gotland. Likewise, merchants from Gotland had their own St. Olaf church and trading house in Novgorod.

The beginning of colonization refers to the period of the calling of the Varangians in 862 and the reign of the descendants of Rurik in Ladoga, Belozero and Polotsk. First, military detachments of Novgorodians, the Ushkuiniki, penetrated into the Vazha region along the rivers on their light boats. Their task was to break the resistance of the local natives and establish their strongholds on this land - graveyards. Merchants followed the Ushkuin warriors, then feudal lords who bought up land. The Novgorodians were interested in hunting grounds rich in furs, collecting tribute and rich booty from the conquered Chud population. In the end, all this was sanctified by the noble goal of Orthodox missionary work, the desire to bring the divine light of Christianity to the wild tribes. Finally, migrant peasants rushed to new territories, unable to survive in their homeland due to the small area of cultivated land. Fugitive people also came to Zavolochye, for some reason forced to flee from Novgorod and the Rostov-Suzdal principality."

Some slobodas were suburban settlements, right behind the city wall. Many of them were subsequently incorporated into cities, and the corresponding toponyms indicate their origin. By the end of the 19th century a sloboda was a large village with more than one church, a marketplace, and volost administration, or a village-type settlement of industrial character, where the peasants have little involvement in agriculture. They encouraged large swathes of Russians to settle du to their tax free nature, and helped integrate local cultures by slowly replacing them."

After the Smolensk War most, but not all of the expensive "foreign formation regiments" had been disbanded. A few thousand foreign formation infantry and dragoons had manned the Abatis Line, but in 1646 the government decided to make foreign formation units an important permanent element in the army. A number of officers were hired abroad, especially in the Netherlands; a war manual on the exercise of musket and pike was translated into Russian, to help in training Muscovite infantry; a new census was conducted to levy troops by household and Tsar Alexis placed thousands of state serfs along the border in standing service as settled dragoons and infantry, drilled in their villages year-round under foreign officers."

The document was signed in the castle in the town of Krewo on 14 August 1385. The Polish nobility had long been dissatisfied with the dynastic union with Hungary (realized through the succession of Louis I of Hungary to Casimir III the Great). In addition, shared interests with Lithuania, such as opposition to the Teutonic Knights and the growing threat posed by the Principality of Moscow, convinced the leaders of the two states to join forces to better counter external threats. Ladislaus II Jagellon (as he was called after his baptism) and Hedwig of Anjou ruled together over the new state of Poland and Lithuania, but in the Grand Duchy effective power was exercised by the king's cousin Vitoldo, who pursued a policy of substantial independence from Krakow. After the death of Queen Hedwig in 1399, Ladislaus Jagiellon remained the sole ruler of Poland and the first of the Jagiellonian dynasty.

This agreement was one of the acts commissioned by Sigismund II Augustus, the last monarch of the Jagellon dynasty: he believed he could preserve his dynasty by adopting an elective monarchy, but his death in 1572 was followed by a three-year interregnum during which adjustments were made to the constitutional system; these adjustments significantly increased the power of the Polish nobility and established a truly elective monarchy."

Zemsky Khrugwai (Land Knights) also recruited free burghers and Polish peasants in person. They were called "pospolitnye Cossacks". In the XV century, the right to declare a ruling was transferred from a king to a Sejm. This restricted the monarchs' possibilities to conduct military actions outside Poland in narrow dynastic interests. Deprived of the right to declare a general mobilization, the king began to attract mercenaries from other countries of Europe and the Zaporizhzhia Cossacks.

However, it was not until the mid-16th century that hussars became the main force of the Polish army. However, the shape and appearance of hussars as we know them today did not take shape until after 1577, when the army of Stefan Batory ended the war with the city of Gdansk. The years of hussar's splendor began in 1598 and then gradually decreased as a percentage of the Polish army. In the times of Batory hussars constituted as much as 90 percent of horse cavalry, in the years 1600-1605 it was already 60-70 percent and in the years 1627-1633 only 40-50 percent."

However, it was used for other purposes. In 1477 a project of maintaining 7000 cavalry and 1000 infantry in the south-eastern borderlands was put forward at the Piotrków congress, and a permanent tax was proposed for this purpose. At the beginning of 1479, the general command of the common defense was exercised by the hetman of the enlisted troops, Jan Polak Karnkowski. At that time letters of command were issued for sixteen infantry rotas and seventeen cavalry flags. In total the infantry consisted of about 1200 soldiers and 60 horses, the cavalry of about 900 horses. On November 2, 1492, letters of commendation were issued to six rotes for 1024 cavalry. In 1493 the common defense numbered 1500 cavalry. In 1497 its troops took part in the Moldavian expedition of Jan Olbracht."

The document had been drawn up by the Diet of the Confederation and its signature, as a complement to the Enrician Articles, which were permanent fundamental principles of government, was a condition for the king's accession to the throne. The Diet of Confederation inaugurated the elective monarchy when Jan Zamoyski de Jelita helped elect Henry of Valois (Henryk Walezy) as king of the Polish-Lithuanian Union. From the time of Sigismund Vasa's accession to the throne, the distinction between the Pacta conventa and the Enrician Articles disappeared.

On 30 August 1356, the king approved customs, freedoms, and privileges in worship and administrative matters for Monophysite Armenians. In a document of 1341, he guaranteed the followers of the Orthodox Church respect for their rites and customs. Thanks to this attitude of King Casimir, Poland became the first multi-confessional state in Europe where the royal court was Catholic. Tolerance for schismatics, however, did not extend to heresies originating in the Catholic Church. King Władysław Jagiełło's 1424 edict of Wielun declared Hussitism a crime against the state. But in the same century, the Orthodox nobility enjoyed the same privileges as the Catholic nobility, as did the Armenians. Certain restrictions on Orthodox access to the highest offices in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were lifted by King Zygmunt August in 1563 and 1568."

The magnates were probably created as a result of the accumulation and purchase of landed property. By borrowing money from the nobility on interest-bearing loans in order to buy up landed estates, the magnate became bound to his creditors, which made it possible for rich and enterprising representatives of the nobility to infiltrate the magnate status.

The immediate cause of this change was the defeat at Batoh, during which most of the Polish prisoners-of-war who were the backbone of the professional army was murdered. The name was formed from the compte, i.e. the army's etat, adopted by the Sejm. The term itself comes from the Latin computus (account).

In addition, there were still some military units formed on the basis of conscription: the Chosen Infantry and, from 1653, also the Patch Infantry (from 1673 the Smoke Infantry).

At the time, only males from aristocratic families were taught to read and write hanja, making the vast majority of Koreans effectively illiterate.

Between 1374 and 1376, Korea began the production of gunpowder and in 1377, Choe Mu-seon, a Korean scholar discovered how to obtain gunpowder by extracting potassium nitrate from the ground. From this discovery, he developed the Juhwa, the first Korean rocket, followed by the development of the singijeon.

Yi Ik, another precursor, created a sort of counter-mandarine college by specializing in a wide range of political and social studies. This movement was opposed to the neo-Confucian tradition, which had come to lose itself in metaphysical discussions, in 'Byzantine quarrels', which clumsily concealed their appetite for power.

 hie_fra_dragonnades_desc: "The Edict of Nantes signed in 1598 by Henry IV ended the Religion Wars in France. By adding political and military privileges, Henry IV greatly reduced protestant upset and bring (civil) peace through France. Everything could have stayed that way, but Louis XIV decided otherwise. Henry IV's grandson aimed a religious uniformity in his kingdom. After offering financial incentives to convert, he decided in 1681 to take a more... active path to convince them. By billeting dragoons and infantrymen in protestant homes with an order to harass and intimidate occupants, the policy was undoubtedly more efficient than the diplomatic way. After some years -and some burned churches-, the Huguenots massively fled to Switzerland, Dutch Republic, and Germany. Louis XIV won his bet, and France would henceforth be Catholic."

One of the few regimes in late medieval Europe that could be called benevolent, the Burgundian State founded the Estates-General of The Low Countries as a guarantor of those rights and a way for the citizens both noble and common to have representation before the king.

 hie_pru_goosestep_desc: "The "Stechschritt" originated in the 18th century, like other march steps, as a method of keeping troops lined up properly as they advanced towards enemy lines. It was introduced into German military tradition by Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. The goose step is a difficult marching style that takes much practice and coordination. It is therefore reserved for ceremonial occasions such as military parades. Because it is difficult to maintain for long periods of time, troops typically only begin to goose-step when they approach the reviewing stand and return to a normal march step once they have marched past. Large military parades require several days of practice to ensure that troops can perform the goose step without injuring themselves. Preparatory training includes having soldiers march in small groups, with arms linked to maintaining balance.\n\nIn the most rigorous form of the goose step, often found in guard mounting ceremonies, the pace is done at a slow march, and the leg is nearly horizontal, and sometimes well beyond. In a standard goose step, found in large military parades, the pace is done at a quick march and the leg is raised only to knee-height, or even to calf height. The lower goose step improves balance and unit cohesion at the tempo of a quick march. Flagbearers and honor guards will frequently march with a higher goose step than the mass of troops following."

Prussia was among the first countries in the world to introduce tax-funded and generally compulsory primary education, consisting of an eight-year course of primary education, called Volksschule. It provided not only basic technical skills needed in a modernizing world but also music and religious education in close cooperation with the churches and tried to impose a strict ethos of duty, sobriety, and discipline. Mathematics and calculus were not compulsory at the start, and taking such courses required additional payment by parents. Frederick the Great also formalized further educational stages, the Realschule and as the highest stage the Gymnasium, which served as a university-preparatory school."

 hie_teu_eastern_crusade_desc: "Although the offensive capacity of the Teutonic knights had been weakened by the great revolt, the plans to advance eastward did not stop. The Barthi, Natangi and Varmians converted to Christianity, but the Sudovians and Lithuanians in the east remained pagans and continued the struggle with the Germans."
 hie_teu_knights_empire: "Knights of the Empire"

 hie_teu_magister_germaniae: "Magister Germaniae"
 hie_teu_magister_germaniae_desc: "Since the Middle Ages, the passage of the title was extremely efficient. On the death of a Grand Master, the Vice Master convened the General Council for the election of a successor. The General Chapter was made up of twelve people: seven knights, four sergeants and a priest. Once the majority candidate was chosen, the minority also had to trust him. The election usually ended three months after the death of the Grand Master who passed away."

 hie_teu_prussian_junkers_desc: "Despite being members of the higher edelfrei nobility their title was usually not strong enough to warrant them any real political strength, therefore their carreer was mostly created in the military as soldiers, mercenaries, and officials at the court of territorial princes."

Successive caliphs and emirs learned fromthis mistake, and used the proud cities to their advantage in  their rule. By granting taifas certain rights and privileges, we can greatly expand our influence even outside of our of icial borders."

 hie_adu_propagate_maliki_school_desc: "The great Islamic law scholar Malik was a product of Al-Andalus, and spread from there to much of the Islamic world.

 hie_adu_import_berber_armies: "Import Berber Armies"
 hie_adu_import_berber_armies_desc: "The wild barbarians of the desert were instrumental to the Islamic invasion of Spain.

 hie_ara_almogavars: "Almogavars"
 hie_ara_almogavars_desc: "Originally the tough, hardy shepherds of the Aragonese mountains during the early Reconquista, the Crown of Aragon developed a citizen militia based on those traditions. Tough but light, and expert in the use of darts and combined arms, these formed the vanguard of the Aragonese Reconquista. Their use of the terrain caught on elsewhere, and eventually these Aragonese light infantry sold their services around the Mediterranean. However, the Crown of Aragon itself never forgot the lessons of using the men of the land itself as the core of its infantry."
 hie_ara_crown_aragon: "Crown of Aragon"
 hie_ara_crown_aragon_desc: "Aragon began as a mere county in the Pyrenees among other squabbling Christian Spanish kingdoms. However, by adopting a unique decentralized rule and by spearheading much of the Reconquista, we have been elevated to a kingdom and have been able to spread our influence much farther than our humble ancestors could ever have dreamed possible"
 hie_ara_feuros_aragon: "Fueros de Aragón"
 hie_ara_feuros_aragon_desc: "In a unique combination of Iberian, Visigothic, and Latin influences, the Aragonese princes invented the concept of the fueros. These were documents outlining rights and privileges of both the towns and the nobility simultaneously, rather than favoring one or the other as was common elsewhere. While this did reduce crown authority, it also laid a foundation for an early concept of individual rights and made it possible to govern vast holdings as a stable kingdom rather than collapsing into revolts."
 hie_ara_thalassocracy: "Thalassocracy"
 hie_ara_thalassocracy_desc: "Once the threat of the Moors in eastern Spain was gone, there were only other Spanish Christian kingdoms left for expansion on the mainland. Rather than betray their blood brothers who continued the fight further south, Aragon has turned to the sea. Much of the power of Aragon came from uniting the various petty island realms of the Mediterranean into one cohesive kingdom. By uniting our realms via the sea, we brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to the Western Mediterranean, through uniform laws, the clearing the seas of piracy, and creating safe harbors rather than hostile shores."
 hie_ara_consulate_sea: "Consulate of the Sea"

As the last bastion of Christian Spain, we know that not only does it fall to us to reclaim the entire peninsula for the Cross, but also that it is our holy obligation to do so. The idea of a divine reconquest was unique to this long and grueling war, and allowed Asturias to liberate huge swathes of territory from the Moors despite their desperate position following the initial Moorish invasion."
 hie_asu_santiago_matamoros: "Santiago Matamoros"
 hie_asu_santiago_matamoros_desc: "Having the right to the land gave Asturias the ability to reclaim land, but first we must defeat the Moorish menace. Against such reckless hate, it often seemed as if miracles were needed. Such a miracle was granted to us when St. James himself appeared on a white horse and slew many of the fiends. God himself, through his warrior James, is on our side. Every Asturian will die before he sees the dream of the Reconquista thwarted or Asturian lands ever again violated!"
 hie_asu_strategic_depopulation: "Strategic Depopulation"
 hie_asu_strategic_depopulation_desc: "The protection of our terrain and the valor of our people were sometimes not enough to stop the hateful tide of the Moors. Because of this, our kings invented a process whereby the inhabitants of a frontier area were forcibly relocated further away to deprive the advancing armies of any advantage. This caused hardship for many, but none more than the Moors who sought to continue their relentless invasions."
 hie_asu_refuge_mozarabs: "Refuge for Mozarabs"
 hie_asu_refuge_mozarabs_desc: "Whatever they may claim, the caliphs were hardly gentle and tolerant taskmasters of their Christian subjects. Seeking to escape the harsh taxation and religious persecution, many Christians under Moorish rule, known as Mozarabs, were welcomed in Asturias. We keep the tradition of accepting like-minded refugees from anywhere they may be found to increase our own strength."

 hie_asu_cruz_victoria_desc: "The cross of Pelayo the King has been remade! With the newfound riches of the advancing Reconquista, we have bestowed what this cross truly deserves in the form of gold and gems. This will be our national symbol and a constant reminder of our obligation to holy war."
 hie_asu_asturian_art: "The Asturian Art"
 hie_asu_asturian_art_desc: "Isolated from the medley of Arab, Byzantine, and Latin styles occurring down south, the Asturian realm developed it's own unique style of quasi-Romanesque architecture known as the Asturian art.

Their use of local materials not only made aesthetic sense but allowed for the quick proliferation of the art."
 hie_asu_first_crusader_kings: "First Crusader Kings"
 hie_asu_first_crusader_kings_desc: "Long before the Pope declared the first crusade for the holy land, we received papal blessing for our glorious holy war. Long before Jerusalem was reclaimed, we were reclaiming Holy Spain from the infidel. Because of our status, the Pope granted us the title of kingdom, first among the peninsula. Let us never forget our nation was built on the first, longest, and most successful Crusade."

The constant warfare and preparation for warfare over the centuries has made our whole population ready to bear arms at a moment's notice."
 hie_cas_toledo_steel: "Toledo Steel"
 hie_cas_toledo_steel_desc: "Toledo has been a center of high-quality swordmaking for centuries; even the armies of Hannibal were eager to buy iron swords from here.

 hie_cas_royal_universities: "Royal Universities"
 hie_cas_royal_universities_desc: "While most of Europe's first universities were originally cathedral schools, the monarchy in Castile took steps to establish their own centers of higher learning, after the manner of the Visigoths of old.

 hie_cas_encomienda: "Encomienda"
 hie_cas_encomienda_desc: "A unique Castilian adaptation of feudalism, encomiendas were first used to resettle reconquered Spanish lands after the conquest and reconquest devastated them. Nobles who participate in the reconquest are given authority over tracts of land. In exchange for resettling the area with Christians and ensuring productivity of the land, they can gain title over vast territories, though not as outright owners but simply managers for the crown, unlike more traditional feudalism."
 hie_cas_imperator_hispaniae: "Imperator Hispaniae"
 hie_cas_imperator_hispaniae_desc: "Not since the Romans has the peninsula been united under one banner. However, even through the centuries-long conquest and reconquest, the identity of the Spaniae has endured.

 hie_cas_castilian_language: "Castilian Language"
 hie_cas_castilian_language_desc: "Originating in the sparsely-populated borderlands between Leon and the Islamic states, Castilian has quickly caught on as the default language of the peninsula.

A type of parliament, the Generalitat also served as a court whereby peasants and merchants alike could being grievances against the nobles and the crown, and vice versa. Preserving the unique harmony of the Catalan realm greatly strengthens the foundation of any state which deigns to rule it."
 hie_cat_catalan_constitutions: "Catalan Constitutions"
 hie_cat_catalan_constitutions_desc: "Despite the name, the Catalan Constitutions functioned more as a combination of law code and constitution rather than the more classical constitutional model. However, centralizing the law as a single body was an important reform that allowed the Catalans a much more stable society."

 hie_cat_catalan_company: "The Catalan Company"
 hie_cat_catalan_company_desc: "Originally a band of crusaders, the men of the Catalan Company became one of the most widely-travelled mercenary bands in the Mediterranean.

 hie_cat_remenca_pagesos_desc: "After the War of the Peasants, we have recognized that the best way to both keep the peasants loyal while still allowing for them to work the land is to promise a way out. Unique in Europe, our system now allows peasants to buy their status as freemen. While most will not be able to take this option, the ones that do can pursue crafts and trade, while the ones that remain work all the harder to try and achieve this goal."

Whether this actually happened or not, the lesson resounded throughout the generations: we must always maintain our arms and the use of them if we are to not fall to invasion."
 hie_gal_sanctuaria_santiago: "Sanctuaria de Santiago"
 hie_gal_sanctuaria_santiago_desc: "In his quest to spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth, St. James found his final resting place here. Over the years, the presence of his relics has become a defining aspect of Galician culture, as his cathedral at Santiago de Compostela is a pilgrimage destination second only to Rome and Jerusalem itself."
 hie_gal_camino_real: "El Camino Real"
 hie_gal_camino_real_desc: "Not only did the pilgrimages shape Galician identity, but they also provided vital revenue to the armies of the Reconquista. Eventually, a royal road was established between the Basque country and Santiago de Compostela. This created a standard “Camino' or route for the pilgrims and made it possible for many more to visit from distant lands."
 hie_gal_fogar_breogan: "Fogar de Breógan"
 hie_gal_fogar_breogan_desc: "The ancientest legends from both Galicia and Ireland, though separated for hundreds if not thousands of years, both agree on one thing: the first inhabitants of Ireland, and possibly the entire British Isles, first set sail from Galicia.

 hie_gal_santiago_cierra: "Santiago Y Cierra"

 hie_gal_maritime_highways: "Maritime Highways"
 hie_gal_maritime_highways_desc: "While myths claim it was built by Breogan, ancestor of both Galicia and Ireland, it is more likely that it was built by the Romans as their last outpost to the West.

 hie_gra_al_andalus_desc: "While in the past we have referred to the Muslim realms here simply by their dynastic names, such as the Umayyaad, Almohad, or Almoravid, our thinkers have invented the idea of a Muslim Spanish nation-state, named Al-Andalus. With this, we can more readily justify our aspirations to conquer the peninsula, as we are more than simply an emirate of this area, but the heirs to a nation-state; never mind that this state never actually existed."
 hie_gra_volunteers_faith: "Volunteers of the Faith"
 hie_gra_volunteers_faith_desc: "Desperate to cling on to their independence, the rulers of Granada sought to counter the influx of crusading forces by making a religious appeal of their own to preserve the last Muslim state in Western Europe. This worked wonders for the Granadans, as men arrived from throughout the Islamic world. These faithful warriors were formed into their own corps, the Volunteers of the Faith."
 hie_gra_strait_fibraltar: "Strait of Gibraltar"
 hie_gra_strait_fibraltar_desc: "In ancient times, these waters, known by the Romans as the Pillars of Hercules, were considered to be one of the far corners of the earth. We know, however, that this strait is destined for greatness as the link between Atlantic and Mediterranean by sea and between Africa and Europe by land. Because of this, our ancestors bestowed our own name on it. Jabal Tariq (Mount Tarik) is its name, a name which will ring through history for a thousand years!"

 hie_gra_use_old_build_new_desc: "The strategy of our forefathers to destroy infidel buildings, only to borrow from them for our own, has never been more evident than in the citadel of Granada itself. The entire city is built of the ruins of cities from days gone by. Naturally this makes Granadan construction quite efficient."
 hie_gra_canals_cisterns_towers: "Canals, Cisterns, and Towers"
 hie_gra_canals_cisterns_towers_desc: "Granada is known as the land of pomegranates. Like the seeds of the pomegranate are its many forts, standing tall and proud against the Christian infidels. Not only are there many forts, but each is equipped with interlocking systems of canals and cisterns, guarded by towers. This triple-layered defense makes starving us out of any siege very difficult."

 hie_gra_garnata_al_yahud_desc: "The Jewish People of the Book have had a spotty history in Muslim Spain. However, among all the emirates of the peninsula, Granada has been one of the most friendly to the Jews.

Noblest of all the crusading orders of Europe, the Knights were vital to the key victories of the Reconquista, including the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Unlike other orders, entrance to the Knights was not restricted to those with certain bloodlines, and marriage of members was permitted. This ensured a much more stable and long-lasting order than most that came out of the Levantine Crusades."

 hie_por_tordesillas_desc: "Rather than contest the upstart claims of the Castilians by force of arms, being after all weary of centuries of warfare, the Portuguese Crown came up with a diplomatic solution. By involving the Holy Father's mediation, we can not only secure our own claims to huge swathes of territory in perpetuity, but also secure our eastern neighbor as a friend rather than as a foe."

Often considered the first industrial complexes, these gave the Portuguese a decisive edge in their fledgling trade empire."
 hie_por_cartazes: "Cartazes"
 hie_por_cartazes_desc: "Despite being far from the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese system of the Cartaz has allowed them to maintain a high degree of control there. By demanding (some might say extorting) payment for a letter of a license, and declaring ships lacking such a letter to be rightful targets for seizure, we can highly increase the importance of our trading ports as well as our own merchant ships. If local traders complain that we are nothing but pirates for doing so, that is their problem."

 hie_por_portalan_charts_desc: "It is not enough to simply have ships capable of braving the stormy Atlantic and leaving the Mediterranean behind. The Portalan Charts were the first accurate and exact navigation maps to exist, making it possible to maneuver more safely on the high seas and allowing Portuguese sailors to sail in the deep sea rather than hug the treacherous coastlines. This of course allowed their navy to cover far more area than was usual in the Early Modern period."

In order to manage this vast empire, the first modern colonial bureaucracy, the Casa de Contracion in Sevilla, was established. Although often inefficient, this system proved durable and efective at managing Spain's unprecedented overseas empire and ensuring that el Quinto Real (the King's Fifth) of gold was paid."

The Naib was the most influential post and virtually enjoyed all the powers of the Sultan. He had control over all the other departments. The post of Wazir was next to the Naib and he headed the finance department known as the Diwan-i-Wizarat. An Auditor-General for examining expenditure and an Accountant General for checking income worked under the Wazir. The department of religious affairs, Diwan-i-Risalat dealt with pious foundations and granted stipends to deserving scholars and men of piety. This department granted funds for the construction of madrasas, tombs and mosques. It was headed by Chief Sadr who also functioned as Chief Qazi, the head of the judicial system.

The Khalji family would identify themselves with the Indian Muslim communities, and the Indo-Muslim faction would grow in strength due to the rising number of converts. With a series of assassinations, they would finally usurp the throne in 1290 and appoint their Indo-Muslim allies such as Zafar Khan (Minister of War), Nusrat Khan (Wazir of Dehli), Ayn al Mulk Multani, Malik Karfur, Malik Tughlaq, and Malik Nayk (Master of the Horse) who were famous warriors but non-Turks, which resulted in the emergence of an Indo-Muslim state. The internal administrative changes during this period allowed for rapid conquests and territorial expansion of the Sultanate into the rest of India."
 hie_dlh_kharaj: "Kharaj"
 hie_dlh_kharaj_desc: "Alauddin Khalji's taxation system was probably the one institution from his reign that lasted the longest, surviving indeed into the nineteenth or even the twentieth century. The land tax became the principal form in which the peasant's surplus was expropriated by the ruling class. A 50% tax on agricultural produce, the maximum allowed by the Hanafi School, was imposed in a substantial part of northern India. Alauddin also eliminated the intermediary Hindu rural chiefs, and started collecting the Kharaj directly from the cultivators. He did not levy any additional taxes on agriculture, and abolished the cut that the intermediaries received for collecting revenue. Alauddin's demand for tax proportional to land area meant that the rich and powerful villages with more land had to pay more taxes."

 hie_dlh_double_defense_desc: "Balban's military reforms and expertise was one of the greatest reasons that India was spared from the Mongol yoke. Embassies were exchanged and established between the Sultanate and the Hordes, in order to establish fast communication in case of victory, as well as vast defensive lines across areas like Lahore and Sunam. These lines helped defend vital chokepoints by the Hindu Kush mountains, and large metropolises such as the capital itself."

However, fearing invasion, the Rajput Raja to the south, Rana Sanga, rallied his growing realm against the Lodi's, with the riches of Gujarat and the Manpower of the Malwa Plateau behind him, as well as the horse-riding Rajputs that followed him with zealotry.

Its volume expanded with its broader usage, gradually edging out the cowry for macro economic functions and relegating that denomination to micro economic status. The normative money was the Tanka, a relatively heavy pure silver coin, supplemented by a 'small change' of cowry shells. cowries doubtless were used in the majority of transactions involving physical money. They were the money of choice for revenue payments from the small holdings, ferry tolls, etc. They were the money of daily market exchanges, foodstuffs, basic apparel and the like. Where the labour market was monetised, cowries provided salaries for labourers. They were the 'money of the people' for their time and place."

The noble intention of preaching Islam was the main factor which drove them to leave their hearth and home for Bengal. They came to Bengal, often alone, and preached Islam in the secluded areas throughout their lives under unfavourable circumstances. While the social and religious condition of the people was caste divided, the Sufis came here carrying with them the egalitarian message of Islam. Because of their strong belief in Allah, and theoretical and practical teachings of universal brotherhood, Sufis could easily satisfy the spiritual cravings of the masses. The activities of the Sufis and their inherent qualities made them familiar to the masses, who were already groaning under social tyranny and suffering from the agony of spiritual yearnings of the soul"

At the Battle of Panipat and Battle of Khanwa, he commanded his cannon batteries. His role in these battles as commander of the artillery was a vital one, as it was the rifleman and cannons under Mustafa Rumi and Ustad Ali Quli that won the day. Babur's early relations with the Ottomans were poor because the Ottoman Sultan Selim I provided Babur's rival Ubaydullah Khan with powerful matchlocks and cannons. In 1507, when ordered to accept Selim I as his rightful suzerain, Babur refused and gathered Qizilbash servicemen in order to counter the forces of Ubaydullah Khan during the Battle of Ghazdewan. In 1513, Selim I reconciled with Babur (fearing that he would join the Safavids), dispatched Ustad Ali Quli and Mustafa Rumi the matchlock marksman, and many other Ottoman Turks, in order to assist Babur in his conquests; this particular assistance proved to be the basis of future Mughal-Ottoman relations. From them, he also adopted the tactic of using matchlocks and cannons in field (rather than only in sieges), which would give him an important advantage in India."
 hie_mug_sawar_and_zat: "Sawar and Zat Ranks"
 hie_mug_sawar_and_zat_desc: "Zat and Sawar were used to indicate ranks of a Military official in Mansabdari system under Mughals. The Mughal emperors maintained a large and efficient army till the reign of Aurangzeb. The credit of organizing the Mughal nobility and army systematically goes to Akbar. The steel-frame of Akbar's military policy was the mansabdari system. Through it he set up a bureaucracy which was half-civil and half-military in character. The mansab awarded to an individual fixed both his status in the official hierarchy and also his salary. It also fixed the number of armed retainers the holders of mansab was to maintain. The system was formulated to streamline rank of the nobles, fix their salary and specify the number of cavalry to be maintained by them. Later the rank of mansabdar came to be denoted by two numbers - Zat and-Sawar. The Zat denoted personal rank of an official and the Sawar indicated the size of contingents maintained by the mansabdars. Depending on the strength of contingent Mansabdars were placed in three categories. Let us take the example of a mansabdar who had a rank of 7000 zat and 7000 sawar (7000/7000). In the first Zat and Sawar ranks were equal (7000/7000). In the second, Sawar rank was lower than the Zat but stopped at half, or fifty percent, of the Zat rank (7000/4000). In the third, Sawar rank was lower than fifty percent of the Zat rank (7000/3000). Thus the Sawar rank was either equal or less than the Zat."

 hie_mug_guns_and_cannons_desc: "During the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Jaigarh Fort, became one of the worlds most efficient Cannon foundries mainly due to the abundance of Iron ore mines in the vicinity of the fort. The Mughal cannon foundry Jaigarh Fort had a massive wind-tunnel that sucked air from the high mountains into its furnace and the heated air would melt the metal. The liquid molten metal would fill a reservoir chamber and into a cannon mould in the casting pit. Most of the Mughal Cannons were massive mostly 16 ft long and had to be prepared within a single day. The Mughals also built a large ingenious mechanical device that had a precision gear system driven by four pairs of Oxen, the device was used for hollowing out the Cannon barrels. Mughal cannon production reached its zenith during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, including the most impressive of the Mughal cannons: The Zafarbaksh, which is a very rare composite cannon, that required skills in both wrought iron forge welding and bronze casting technologies. Polymaths were employed in assistance of cannon development, such as Fathullah Shirazi, a Persian polymath and mechanical engineer who created an early form of the volley gun."

The government funded the building of irrigation systems across the empire, which produced much higher crop yields and increased the net revenue base, leading to increased agricultural production. The Zabt system replaced the tribute system, previously common in India and used by Tokugawa Japan at the time, with a monetary tax system based on a uniform currency. Revenue was biased in favour of higher value cash crops such as cotton, indigo, sugar cane, tree-crops, and opium, providing state incentives to grow cash crops, in addition to rising market demand. Under the zabt system, the Mughals also conducted extensive cadastral surveying to assess the area of land under plow cultivation, with the Mughal state encouraging greater land cultivation by offering tax-free periods to those who brought new land under cultivation."

Sher Shah, the founder of the Suri dynasty, was sent by hisfather Hasan Khan Sur for the purpose of education from Sasaram to Jaunpur. Islamic religious education, particularly the Quran, hadith, tafsir, fiqh, usul-i fiqh, nahv, mantiq and several other subjects, weretaught in the centers of learning here. Bibi Raji, the first and favourite queen of Ibrahim Sharqi, established some madrasas here for the girls. The fame of the scholars of Jaunpur reached far and wide, even abroad. When Humayun migrated to Persia in exile, the Safavid ruler Shah Abbas enquired from him about the state of the scholars and sufis of Jaunpur. Humayun was very much impressed to learn about the fame of the Jaunpur scholars in Persia.

The Gajapati kings like that of the Gangas were famous for their military organisation. Militarism penetrated into all ranks of the society and all able-bodied persons were called upon to perform military service. The king had a standing army, but the number of the local militia was far greater than the number of the soldiers in the standing army. Besides, the feudal lords also supplied to the king a stipulated number of soldiers at the time of war and had to fight for him in the battle field, thus it can be said the Odishan organisation was very well streamlined for its time. The first division was known as the Hantakaru Daa Le, the pioneer force clearing jungles and making roads; the second was known as the Aguani Thata i.e., the advance units; the third was Pradhana Vala i.e., the main army and the fourth division was Pachhiani Thata i.e., the rear guards.

At the time of the greatest territorial expansion of the duchy they controlled a very large area south of the Po and had a quarter of a million subjects. Despite the local differences between the various centers, they adapted and simultaneously overlapped the existing territorial institutions. Towards Ferrara, in particular, they had a lot of attention, expanding it with numerous additions (the most important was the Addizione Erculea) to give it the appearance of a modern city and the dignity of a capital. Even if few of the Este lords were truly aware of the cultural implications of their government, they all grasped the political fallout deriving from the protection of the arts and letters against other dynasties. They showed great tolerance towards Jews by welcoming them from the earliest days of their presence in the city, and Ferrara became a reference point for exiles from Spain and Portugal, perhaps one of the few alternatives to Prague. And from the Jews they received enormous advantages, obtaining improvements in ducal businesses and, not infrequently, economic support for their businesses. The attitude towards the Protestants was different. During the period of Renata di Francia's stay in the city, Ferrara became a center of proselytism for the Calvinists and this could only create great difficulties with the Vatican, such as to become one of the premises for the loss of the fief."

Militating as a captain first under the flags of Venice and then of Milan, he expanded the borders of the Gonzaga state with the territories he received in exchange for their military services. The survival of the small state was strongly tied to its ability to offer military strength and expertise to major powers in exchange for protection."

The projects started in 1484 following the siege of Ferrara by the Republic of Venice. The first reasons were therefore essentially defensive, expanding the city area within the walls (The bulwark of the Barco is among the most archaic examples of modern fortification) but the project did not lack an urban vision linked to the concept of an ideal city and a realization of the aspirations of Hercules, linked to his training at the court of Naples, where he had learned to love classical architecture and art."

Later he knew how to always surround himself with artists and writers and made the Este court a center of European importance. In Ferrara at that time personalities such as Pietro Bembo, Ludovico Ariosto, Tiziano, Giovanni Bellini, Dosso Dossi and the sculptor Antonio Lombardo were welcomed. These masters decorated the Camerino delle Pitture and the Studio dei Marmi in the private apartment on the Via Coperta, which still today unites the castle to the ducal palace. Unfortunately the paintings and marble reliefs were dismantled and dispersed in 1598 by the papal legate after the Duchy of Ferrara passed to the Papal State. For a certain period he assigned the governorship of Garfagnana to Ariosto and personally cultivated a passion for music and architecture. Ludovico Ariosto also dedicated Orlando furioso to Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, brother of Duke Alfonso."

The work was commissioned by the Marquis Niccolò II d'Este to the architect Bartolino da Novara, former architect of the Castello Visconteo di Pavia and the Castello di San Giorgio di Mantova. The Marquis considered it essential to have a fortified structure for the defense of his court after the popular revolt which broke out in May of that same year. At the news of yet another tax increase, the Ferrarese had risen up asking for the delivery of the judge of the wise Tommaso da Tortona, adviser to the Marquis and held responsible for the taxes that weighed on the people that were actually wanted by the lord.

Azzo VI d'Este, in power until 1212, was the first lord of Ferrara, mayor of Mantua and Verona. While he was in Verona the Salinguerra chased the Este from Ferrara, then Azzo VI found himself having to fight with Salinguerra Torelli and with Ezzelino the Monk, his ally. Emperor Otto IV of Brunswick took the field in his favor and obtained a truce between the opposing forces.

The people of Ferrara waited for a providential flood of the Po to lift the ships up to the line of fire of the guns, then ordered them to fire, destroying a large part of the fleet. The naval defeat of the Venetian Republic by a land army made a great impression on contemporaries. Alfonso I then went down in history as an artillery duke, being a technical artillery expert, a metallurgist and a cannon smelter. His artillery gained great fame in Europe, so much so that the invention of the grenade has been attributed to him. He also devised a gunpowder manufacturing system. He was also an expert in fortifications, and the walls of Ferrara, considered among the safest and most modern in Europe, were admired and celebrated by Ariosto, Michelangelo and Rabelais. Alfonso also used his firearms on the occasion of the siege of Padua by the emperor Maximilian, in 1509. His blows managed to create a breach in the city walls and the city was not conquered only because of a betrayal. The emperor nevertheless wanted to thank the Este family by investing him as lord of Este and Montagnana."

Enlistment was the responsibility of two people, generally nobles too, who had to evaluate every single man in parameters such as his value and visual ability. Each candidate had to present a guarantee to be hired, and his guarantor undertook to reimburse the Republic in case of disobedience or desertion. All the crossbowmen hired swore loyalty to the Republic and were paid directly by it, with a fixed term generally less than a year. With some frequency they were recruited from individuals belonging to the lower strata of society, often they were individuals recently immigrated to Genoa or small artisans who, without employment, abandoned, even temporarily, their usual work at the search for more luck. From the records preserved, we can thus observe that many crossbowmen were originally from Savona, from the Genoese hinterland, from Oltregiogo and Monferrato, from some places in the Po Valley (Parma, Piacenza, Pavia) and Corsica."

In order to pay the freight charges of the company, assumed entirely by the municipality, the consuls of 1149 transfer the income of some gabelles for 15 years, towards the advance of 1300 Genoese lire, to a company of 18 citizens, each of whom share for one part. In this financial loan operation, called purchase, the Genoese State commits a part of the ordinary income against payment of the annual fruit to a company of lending citizens called comperisti who advance the capital, obliging themselves to repay the capital within the pre-established term. Given the success, the operation was periodically repeated in the following years, growing at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The historical occasion of the constitution of the Casa delle compere e dei benchi di San Giorgio was the financial collapse of the Compagna Communis (this was the name of the medieval town of Genoa before it became a republic), caused by the harsh wars against Venice. The body was founded by a state provision with a decree of 27 April 1407 from the meeting of all the already existing "purchases", which had made loans to the State, to manage the public debt of the Compagna communis in a unitary way. The House, Office and then Banco di San Giorgio continued to grant new loans to the Republic of Genoa.

Likewise, Genoa was able to gather numerous fleets in a short time, such as the 88 galleys in Meloria or the 85 in Curzola. The Republic was responsible for regulating all matters. The first rules in this regard date back to the mid-fourteenth century - the rules of Gazaria, ancient name of the Crimea - which deal precisely with the galleys used for trade with the colonies on the Black Sea. The rules of Gazaria is one of the oldest sources of maritime law in Europe. In 1559 with the peace of Cateau Cambresis, which put an end to the war between the allied Spain and France and after the battle of Lepanto (1576), the need was felt for a permanent, public fleet. He was to be under the command of regular officers, patrolling the Tyrrhenian Sea infested with Barbary pirates. The Magistrate of the Galleys was therefore established."

It also served as a criminal court over the crews and commanders of galley. Once the previous Arsenal Magistrate was suppressed, the task of ordering and following the construction of new boats was assigned to that of the Galleys. The seven constituent members of this Magistrate took the title of Provisori. They enslaved the enemies, but they worried about the fate of their fellow citizens, completely ignoring any concept of equality and the essential value of all human life. It is clear that, with those treatments, the convicts had a short life and that a continuous turnover on board the galleys was therefore necessary. In 1646 a new kind of crew was established for the galleys, no longer made up of slaves but rather of free men, regularly paid for their work. The galleys of liberty were born, driven no longer by the force of arms of the convicts, but by the work of volunteers, who will be called buonavoglia."

These cities, exposed to pirate raids and neglected by the central powers, autonomously organized their own defense, combining the exercise of maritime trade with that of its armed protection; they were then able, in the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries, to go on the offensive, obtaining numerous victories against the Saracens, starting with the historic battle of Ostia in 849.

The Gonzaga collections themselves became an example for the European courts, also for the proverbial intuition shown by the Gonzagas in the choice of the works of their contemporaries. Likewise, art collecting became an instrument of representation and communication in the subtle diplomatic game to which the small Mantuan state necessarily had to apply. The maximum splendor came during the government of the Dukes Vincenzo I Gonzaga and Ferdinando (son of Vincenzo I).

The production capacity of the city was such that after the defeat of Maclodio (1427), only two families of gunsmiths were able to provide in a few days to two thousand armor for infantry and four thousand harnesses for horses for the soldiers released from Carmagnola. It is known that Gian Galeazzo Visconti in 1391 granted immunity and familiarity to the court blacksmith Simone de Correntibus that a few years earlier he had already granted to Giovanni Meravigli. However, it was in the fifteenth century that the city achieved primacy thanks to the invention of the complete armor of plates "Milanese style" (the most common along with the Gothic). It was characterized by asymmetrical shoulder straps, of greater size and thickness on the left side, where the rider was more likely to receive blows, plates that went to cover the joints that previously defended only by the underlying iron mesh, a better articulation of the pectoral, panther, flap and pouch thanks to the presence of leather straps that gave greater mobility. A further innovation was the application of a further piece that acted as a bavaria and gorget (wrapper). It was wrapped around the helmet by means of two leather laces that were fixed on the nape of the neck thanks to a washer. In addition to protecting the neck, previously often covered only by iron mail, it guaranteed greater protection to the lower half of the face, in particular from weapons insisted during enemy tournaments or cavalry charges. The Milanese plate armor was exported all over Europe; under Francesco Sforza and Galeazzo Maria Sforza they were bought by Louis XI of France and by Ludovico IX of Bavaria."

Once the approval of the statute was obtained, they were called universities and those that had their own representation, usually made up of consuls, elders or abbots, were called paraticians. Twenty-two are mentioned in a catalog from 1387, although their number varied over time. Even today, the names of many of these corporations survive in the Milanese street book. The statutes provided that each new master, shop owner or warehouse owner registered his trademark in a book kept by the officers of the corporation in order to defend it from competition and as a guarantee for buyers on the quality of the product.

In 1395 Galeazzo was able to obtain the ducal title from the emperor, a dignity that placed his power on a more solid legal basis and gave him a particular authority among the Italian potentates.

On that occasion an army of about 42 800 men was gathered, of which 24 700 knights (of which 2 700 men-at-arms and 22 000 of other types) divided into 140 squads and 18 000 infantrymen (3 780 heavy infantry called 'comrades' and 12 600 infantry called 'pay') divided into two armies.

The contribution of the water from the canal was effectively linked with the centuries-old reclamation and irrigation work of the monks of Chiaravalle, Morimondo, and the other abbeys that had operated south of Milan. The simplification of transport not only facilitated small businesses that previously took place by land but also extended their range of action and enriched the catalog, spreading well-being.

The Duchy mainly imported raw metals, raw wool, horses, saddles, pottery, crystals and saltpetre and exported weapons, armor, and agricultural products there. From France, wool and canvases were imported and armor and tapestries were exported, from Spain leather and wool, from Flanders cloths, canvases, and some fabrics, and from the Scandinavian monarchies rare leathers that cannot be found elsewhere. Credit operations were favored by the introduction of exchange letters, already in use at least since 1325 when Francesco Datini, to whom the invention is attributed, was not even born. There were sixteen Milanese trading branches in the rest of Italy and abroad. The Medici had a constant presence in Milan starting from 1455 thanks to the donation by Francesco Sforza to his friend Cosimo de 'Medici of a beautiful building in the Bossi district where a branch of the Banco Mediceo, directed by Pigello Portinari, was established; it soon became one of the most sumptuous palaces in the city. From the Republic of Venice mainly iron, gold, salt and spices were imported but occasionally also unusual animals such as elephants, lions or particular birds. Many horses were purchased from the Marquisate of Mantua, considered the best in Italy."

This relationship between the royal court and town planning had already manifested itself with Frederick II, who in the 13th century, in the Swabian statute, had concentrated the greatest attention on castles, neglecting the city walls. To the two existing castles, the Angevins added the main one, Castel Nuovo (Chastiau neuf), which was not only a fortification but above all their grandiose palace. \nThe royal residence of Naples had until then been Castel Capuano, but the ancient Norman fortress was judged inadequate for its function and the king wanted to build a new castle near the sea. \nAssigned the project to the French architect Pierre de Chaulnes, the works for the construction of the Castrum Novum began in 1279 and ended just three years later, a very short time given the construction techniques of the time and the overall size of the work. However, the king never resided there: following the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers, which cost Angioino the crown of Sicily, conquered by Peter III of Aragon, and other events, the new palace remained unused until 1285, the year of his death. by Carlo I. \nAlfonso of Aragon, who had conquered the throne of Naples in 1443, wanted to establish in the castle the function of the center of royal power and a court of magnificence that could compete with that of Lorenzo the Magnificent in Florence. The fortress was completely rebuilt in its present form. King Alfonso entrusted the renovation of the old Angevin palace-fortress to an Aragonese architect, Guillem Sagrera, a Catalan from Mallorca, who conceived it in Gothic-Catalan terms. \nThe five round towers, four of which incorporated the previous Angevin towers with a square plan, more suitable for withstanding the shots of the guns of the time, reaffirmed the defensive role of the castle. The importance of the building as a center of royal power was instead underlined by the insertion of the triumphal arch at its entrance, a masterpiece of the Neapolitan Renaissance and the work of Francesco Laurana as well as many artists of various origins."

The main Sicilian architect of the fifteenth century was in fact Matteo Carnilivari who used a personal language with Gothic and Catalan elements, as in the church of Santa Maria della Catena in Palermo. His prestige as a builder was one of the obstacles to the affirmation of the Renaissance language, outside the decorative repertoire of marble workers.

The elementary education of the different weapons is excellent: they maneuver exactly and promptly, both separate and united; The Neapolitan and Sicilian military institutions boast a much older history, which has its foundations in the organization of a "state-owned" (ie state and no longer feudal) army by Ferrante d Aragon in 1464. In particular, the Spanish viceregal period (1503-1714) profoundly marked the military customs of the subsequent Bourbon period. During this time the soldiers of southern Italy were in fact involved in almost all the military events of the Spanish Empire (from the wars of Charles V to the wars of Flanders, from the colonial campaigns in America to the thirty years war), often giving proof of great value and loyalty to the imperial authorities. The captains, belonging to the best feudal nobility of the Neapolitan and Sicilian provinces, were able to frame and prepare the subjects of the two viceroys for war, obeying the firm political direction given by the monarchs of Spain."

At the beginning of our reign, however, the Neapolitan and Sicilian merchant navies were in very bad conditions. The minor ports were closed to traffic and exports were reduced to a minimum. To cope with this situation, our kings enacted a series of rules and provisions aimed at finally making merchant shipping in his State effective. Modern regulations were established for sailors and masters and shipbuilding and professional education were increased in the areas with the longest seafaring tradition (such as in the Sorrento peninsula and in the Campania archipelago). The new course of the Neapolitan and Sicilian merchant navy was also determined by the strengthening of the Navy and also by the elimination of customs privileges for the English, French, Spanish and Dutch woods that caused problems for the national treasury. Look at it now, the woods of the Two Sicilies have resumed trading with the main ports of the Mediterranean, with occasional trips beyond the Pillars of Hercules."

During the next fifty years, the attacks followed with increasing intensity: the construction of the first towers and castles along the coast of Sardinia dates back to this period. \nLater also the Sardinian Giudicati, of Torres, Cagliari, Gallura, and Arborea - the forms of government of Sardinia from the eighth to the fifteenth century - and then the maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa, built numerous coastal fortifications of first defense which, at beginning of the Spanish domination, they amounted to about sixty"

The Giudicati were those of Torres-Logudoro, Calari, Gallura, and Arborea and were ruled by a judge (judike or zuighe in Sardinian, judex in Latin), with the power of the sovereign.

After the interruption of contacts with Constantinople during the 9th and 10th centuries, the four Sardinian judges were formed, including the Giudicato of Torres-Logudoro, with Torres own initial capital. Torres was still the second-largest center on the island politically, religiously, and by demographic size. Around 1065 on the initiative of Judge Comita the Basilica of San Gavino was built, a cathedral until 1441. Already in this period the city of Torres, like all the seaside resorts of the island, began its decline due to malaria and constant pirate raids that began to afflict the coastal cities, leading the population to retreat inland, taking refuge in places such as the nearby village of Sassari, which in this period began its rise to become the major center of the north-west by gradually ousting the ancient Turrian city. In the final stages of the Giudicato it was Sassari that became the capital (even before that there was Ardara, always chosen for the same reasons). The Giudicato ceased to exist in 1259 with Adelasia di Torres. After the dissolution of the Giudicato di Torres the city was absorbed by the free municipality of Sassari. This institution was short-lived because, with the arrival of the fleet of Alfonso IV of Aragon, the free municipality of Sassari undertook to become a vassal state of the nascent Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica commanded by the Aragonese. This subordination became official on July 4, 1323, giving way to the long Aragonese domination that shaped the city."

For many decades and at least until the age of the Restoration it was difficult for the Savoy rulers to eradicate deeply rooted customs and cultural forms, especially among the aristocratic class, but also in the rural population. In the Sardinian languages, the Iberian lexical imprints are still evident, as well as in the customs, the great religious festivals, and in many forms of socialization. In this sense, although the Spanish period is widely considered to be the darkest in the history of the island, it must be admitted that a conspicuous part of the Sardinian cultural heritage still today reveals deep bonds of affinity and sharing with that of the Iberian Peninsula."

It lasted for more than 500 years, from 900 to 1420. \nThe kingdom played a role of great importance in Sardinian history, distinguishing itself from the other judged contemporaries thanks above all to the last farsighted judges who constantly fought to reunite Sardinia under their flag. \nThe other three judges went through deep crises, suffering the interference of the maritime powers of Pisa, Genoa: it was the Arborea, allied to the kingdom of Aragon of which the judge declared himself a vassal, to determine their end and at the same time the Pisan influences in the 'island. Subsequently, it gave life to a bloody war against the kingdom of Sardinia, created by the papacy in 1297 and given to James II of Aragon, with the aim of putting an end to the struggles between Angevins and Aragonese in Sicily. \nIn the Giudicati of Arborea and Cagliari the head of state was above all called judge, in Gallura and Torres also "king"."

The cities (Cagliari, the capital, and again: Iglesias, Oristano, Bosa, Alghero, Sassari, and Castellaragonese), subtracted from the feudal regime, enjoyed wide privileges (customs, commercial, jurisdictional), depended directly on the royal administration (for this they called themselves “royal cities') and sent their own representatives to the Cortes (parliament). In 1543 the equalization before the law of the Sardinians was formalized with the subjects of Iberian origin of the Kingdom of Sardinia. The event that sanctioned the abandonment by the Sardinians of any desire for revenge and the widespread resignation to Iberian domination. Some Sardinian intellectuals will try, over the course of the century, to emancipate the culture of the island from the condition of inferiority to which it had been relegated. Emblematic figures of this renewal were Nicolò Canelles or Canyelles, the first episcopal vicar of Cagliari and then Bishop of Bosa, who founded the first printing house in Sardinia in 1566. \nThe cultural awakening, however, was partly stifled by the action of the Spanish Inquisition, under whose jurisdiction Sardinia was subject, to impose control of Sardinian cultural life, both among the ruling class and at the popular level."

Finally, in the twenties of the century, the two universities of Sassari and Cagliari were legally redefined. For some decades the Jesuit colleges had been operating on the island, which already served as centers of study and training for Sardinian intellectuality.

Instead of the baron, one of his officials, known as podatariu, was responsible for the collection of taxes and duties. These were numerous and often very heavy for the vassals, the inhabitants of the fiefdom. In many cases, their collection was contracted out to the so-called “surrenders', private debt collectors who paid a fixed and previously agreed fee to the administration of the fiefdom and profited from the surplus of taxes. The imposition was therefore aggravated by this practice, with consequent protests and rebellions, in the years of famine. Then there was the problem of jurisdiction, since criminal and civil cases, at least in the first instance, were the responsibility of the lord. Taxation and the administration of justice, therefore, remained firmly in the hands of the aristocratic class."

The site chosen for the new construction was a strip of land between the southern side of Piazza della Signoria and the Lungarno, in a popular district where the river port of Florence was located. The work was entrusted to Giorgio Vasari who was already in charge of the construction site of the adjacent Palazzo Vecchio. The project included a "U" -shaped building, consisting of a long arm to the east, to be incorporated with the ancient Romanesque church of San Pier Scheraggio, a short section overlooking the Arno river, and a short arm to the west, incorporating the Old Mint."

To these Pietro Leopoldo joins you with the important civil, administrative, judicial, and social reforms, thus bringing the Grand Duchy to reach the European vanguard in many sectors.

Obviously, the exchange value of Tuscan coins changed over the centuries. At the time of the Italian unification, the basic currency of the grand duchy was the Tuscan or Florentine lira, equivalent to 84 cents of the Italian lira of the time. One Lira consisted of 20 Tuscan soldi. The mint was in Florence and Pisa.

The small size of the complex in the thirteenth century was proportional to the needs of the city of the time: the seasonal maintenance of a small naval team, a reserve of timber (built-in 1265) and hemp, and a deposit for tools and weapons from 1278. The first expansion of the Arsenale Vecchio took place in the years ranging from 1225 to about 1304, with the addition of an area to the east of the fortified perimeter. The palaces of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise were also built (renovated in the 15th century) which were the residences of the members of the Arsenale Regiment, the institutional body that had the task of governing and supervising the complex, consisting of three Venetian patricians who remained in office for 32 months. Later, between 1304 and about 1322, the first factory of the Corderie della Tana (Casa del Canevo) was built for the production of ropes and the Volto del Bucintoro on the Old dock. In the area called Tana, the ropes, reconstructed several times, were industrially produced naval ropes, a precious commodity in ancient times, at the lowest possible cost, with the advantage of remaining independent from third parties in the event of war."

 hie_ven_armada_desc: "The Venetian navy took the name of Armata (in Venetian: Armada), which was also the name assigned to the individual naval teams and divisions, with a meaning equivalent to that of the fleet. \nFormally, command of the army was always a right and a prerogative of the Doge, which remained intact until the end of the Republic. However, although there is no shortage of cases in which principles even far in the years have taken the position of head of naval operations, the Republic foresaw that at the top of the navy, in case of war, a commander-in-chief would be appointed with the degree of Captain general da mar, commander in chief of naval operations and admiral of the main core of the fleet. \nGalleys were generally divided between free, where the convicts were made up of free men recruited in cash, and forced when the convicts were instead real convicts sentenced to oars. In times of war, the ranks were further thickened by resorting to the zontaroli, condemned from all the territories of the Republic."

The true quality of the island of Murano, however, was the man with the experience of him, who over time has perfected the styles, the quality, and the ability to shape the incandescent glass. These glass artists have always been contacted since the Renaissance to bring their skills to the courts and workshops, so much so that they became masters. In fact, for this reason, a glass school was activated in Murano that initiated young people into this profession even if the experience in the glass factory remained unique. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Murano glass was required by the highest social classes in Europe starting with the invention of crystal in about 1450; the crystal is a quality of glass that differs and that gives the glass itself some peculiar characteristics due to the same silicon base but to a higher percentage of lead oxide (24%), so the products created were particularly refined to satisfy the demand for extremely wealthy clients."

This corps participated in the expedition that led to the conquest of Constantinople (1204). Only in 1550, however, these troops found a definitive arrangement and were called Fanti da Mar. Famagusta, located to the east of the jagged Cypriot coasts, already "Serenissima" conquered by the Venetians in 1489, is besieged by the Ottoman fleet of Mustafà Pascià. After a siege of one year, without the possibility of resisting any longer, left alone by conflicting allies, Marcantonio Bragadin, a soldier of the Republic of Venice, belonging to the body of the "Fanti da Mar" of the Serenissima, decides to sign the surrender after having had a solemn commitment by the Ottoman commander Mustafà, that all the besieged would have their lives saved."

Among these, the introduction of the italic or italic font and the octavo format, are different in terms of manageability and portability, from those most used at the time for manuscripts and incunabula. The first ever Aldine is the Greek grammar, entitled Erotemata, by Constantine Lascaris, which was finished printing on February 28, 1495, and completed with the Alphabetum Graecum on March 8. Among the most famous Aldine we can remember the many editiones principes of Greek classics (Theocritus, Aristotle, Aristophanes, Sophocles, Euripides, Quintus Smyrnaeus, Lysias, Pindar, Licofron, Plato), as well as very rare volumes, such as the Galeomyomachia, by Theodore Prodromo (undated but from 1495), and masterpieces of the press, such as De Aetna, by Pietro Bembo from 1496 and the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili from 1499."

The first was obtained around 1550, transforming large market galleys, to have ships that could exceed ordinary galleys in firepower, without depending exclusively on the strength of the wind for movement and with a limited draft. The first galleys, probably built in secret, were never used in war because they burned in the great fire of the Arsenal in 1569, but immediately after the Master Builder Francesco Bressan with some of his "Proti and Marangoni" reinforced the hull of some large galleys lying unused in the Arsenal, he mounted bow and stern castles there, reducing the oars from 50 to 48 per side, and covered them with a covered deck. Probably already in this case, all the improvements already adopted on the thin Galleys were made (such as the paddle rowing), in a short time because a war against the Ottomans was imminent and foreseen."

We have laid the foundations for what will become very lucrative to traders especially those of the Italian Flemish and Dutch kind. The Templars were most famous for this practice, this system allowed pilgrims all over the Christian world to bank money and non-perishable goods. The system worked as follows: one would deposit money and or goods and a priori, they would get a proof of ownership with the amount and or goods deposited listed. The goods weren't transferable so they could sell them to the order and receive the worth of the goods as a balance, or it would be held for a pre-agreed amount of time for the owner to collect. If the owner didn't collect or came to extend his term the goods would also be forfeited. The money however was transferable for example one could deposit 500 ducats ad the priory in Paris and receive a document that proves that the order owed him 500 ducats and could collect any amount up to 500 ducats from any priory of the affiliated order. So, those 500 ducats in Paris would be able to be collected once he arrived in Rome, Jerusalem, Palermo, Nicosia, Brugge, and Aachen. As long as there was an affiliated priory they could collect. Of course when the owner fails to collect or renew the agreement after the agreed amount of time the money would be forfeited. This system once existed all over western Christendom, and it is time we bring our most lucrative business back.

As they did not recognize the rule of the Latin Empire and considered the Paleologos family pretenders, their loyalty still lies with us. In return, we accept them as Rhomanoi citizens.

It was banding together of the three city-states of Tenochtitlan, Tlacopan, and Texcoco, in the Valley of Mexico against the city-state of Azcapotzalco. The three joined hands to defeat the might of Azcapotzalo in 1428 and founded the Aztec Empire as a result of this alliance. Initially, all three states were peers in the alliance but Tenochtitlan gained an increasingly dominant role in the affairs of the Empire. The Triple Alliance helped the Aztec Empire expand rapidly all over the Valley of Mexico and they subjugated dozens of tributary states."
 hie_azt_flower_wars: "Xochiyaoyotl"
 hie_azt_flower_wars_desc: "This kind of conflict was fought by small armies after previous agreements between the parties. It was not directly aimed at conquering the other city-state but was useful for other reasons. One of the main objectives was the capture of prisoners for sacrifice, surely an important side of the Aztec wars. The Tlacaelelos agreed with the chiefs Tlaxcala, Cholula, Huexotzinco, and Tliliuhquitepec to start ritual battles that would provide each of them with victims to sacrifice to the gods to ask for an end to the famine."

They used to memorize the songs with the relevant deeds of their elders and the praises of their gods, as well as learn and exercising in the handling of weapons such as the atlatl, an instrument used to throw small spears, and the macuahuitl, the wooden sword with obsidian edges."
 hie_azt_shorn_ones: "Cuachicqueh"
 hie_azt_shorn_ones_desc: "The "Shorn Ones" was the most prestigious warrior society - their heads were shaved apart from a long braid over the left ear. Their bald heads and faces were painted one-half blue and another half red or yellow. They served as imperial shock troops and took on special tasks as well as battlefield assistance roles when needed. Over six captives and dozens of other heroic deeds were required for this rank. They apparently turned down captaincies in order to remain constant battlefield combatants. Recognizable by their yellow tlahuiztli, they had sworn not to take a step backward during a battle on pain of death at the hands of their comrades."

They received special battle costumes, representing eagles and jaguars with feathers and jaguar pelts. They became full-time warriors and commanders in the army. Great physical strength, battlefield bravery, and captured enemy soldiers were necessary to obtain this rank."
 hie_azt_travelling_merchants: "Pochteca"
 hie_azt_travelling_merchants_desc: "The pochteca occupied a high position in Aztec society, just below the nobles. The pochteca were responsible for providing materials that the nobles used to display their power. These items were often imported from foreign peoples. The pochteca traded excess tribute (food, clothing, feathers, and slaves) on behalf of the nobles at the market, or took them to other areas to exchange for trade goods. Because of the success of the pochteca, many of them became as powerful as the noble class, but they were obliged to hide this power in public. Trade expeditions often left at night, and the power of the merchants was only displayed in the guild halls. Despite being politically and economically powerful, the pochteca strove to avoid undue attention. The merchants followed their own laws in their trampling, worshipping their god, Yacatecuhtli, "The Lord Who Guides", one of the representations of Quetzalcoatl. Eventually, the merchants were elevated to the rank of warriors in the military orders."

Tlatocayotl, or the principle of rulership, established that descent inherited this divine right. A political order was, therefore, also a cosmic order, and to kill a tlatoani was to transgress that order. For this reason, whenever the Nahuas killed or otherwise removed a tlatoani from their station, their stead typically placed a relative and member of the same bloodline. The establishment of the office of Huetlatoani understood through the creation of another level of rulership, hueitlatocayotl, standing in superior contrast to the lesser tlatocayotl principle."

Initially formed from the Safaviyya Sufi order headed by Shayk Haydar, the group rose to prominence from its connections with other secret societies like the Khurramites and Turko-Shamanism. From then, it expanded greatly among the Turks and Tajiks, helping Shah Ismail I conquer the Aq Qoyunlu tribe across the Tigris and Eastern Persia. For the most part, their loyalty and militarism established a strong Shiite state that, while intolerant of most other Muslims, carved out and independent Persia that survived both Colonialism and Revolution."
 hie_per_caravanserais: "Caravanserais"
 hie_per_caravanserais_desc: "Under the governance of the strong shahs, especially during the first half of the 17th century, traveling through Iran was easy because of good roads and the caravanserais, that were strategically placed along the route. Iranian caravanserais were better built and cleaner than their Turkish counterparts. Caravanserais were designed especially to benefit poorer travelers, as they could stay there for as long as they wished, without payment for lodging. During the reign of Shah Abbas I, as he tried to upgrade the Silk Road to improve the commercial prosperity of the Empire, an abundance of caravanserais, bridges, bazaars, and roads were built, and this strategy was followed by wealthy merchants who also profited from the increase in trade. To uphold the standard, another source of revenue was needed, and road tolls, that were collected by guards (rah-dars), were stationed along the trading routes."
 hie_per_rokn_ol_dowleh: "Rokn Ol-Dowleh"
 hie_per_rokn_ol_dowleh_desc: "The Pillars of the state were evenly split between Military Leaders and Bureaucrat Advisors. The qollar-aghasi, the qurchi-bashi, and the tofangchi-aghasi were notable members of the military branch, yet the focus of administration was centered around checks and balances. The highest level in the government was that of the Prime Minister, or Grand Vizier (Etemad-e Dowlat), who was always chosen from among doctors of the law. He enjoyed tremendous power and control over national affairs as he was the immediate deputy of the Shah. No act of the Shah was valid without the counter seal of the Prime Minister. But even he stood accountable to a deputy, who kept records of his decision-makings and notified the Shah. Second to the Prime Minister's post were the General of the Revenues (mostoufi-ye mamalek), or finance minister, and the Divanbegi, Minister of Justice. n 16th and 17th century Iran, there existed a considerable number of local democratic institutions. Examples of such were the trade and artisan guilds, which had started to appear in Iran in the 1500s. Also, there were the quazi-religious fraternities called futuvva, which were run by local dervishes. Another official selected by the consensus of the local community was the kadkhoda, who functioned as a common law administrator."
 hie_per_persian_rug_production: "Qali-Ye Irani"
 hie_per_persian_rug_production_desc: "The art of carpet weaving in Iran originated more than 2,500 years ago. Persian carpets and rugs were initially woven as articles of necessity to cover the floors of nomadic tribesmen, giving them protection from the cold and damp. The natural progression of the skill and craft involved in the creation of these works of art has been passed down from generation to generation over the centuries throughout periods of peace, invasion, and war. As international trade developed, the variety of patterns and designs grew. The Persian carpet reached its zenith during the reign of the Safavid Dynasty, when Shah Abbas encouraged contacts and trade with Europe and transformed his new capital, Isfahan, into one of the most glorious cities of Persia. He also built workshops for carpets where skilled designers and craftsmen set to work to create splendid specimens. Most of these carpets were made of silk, with gold and silver threads adding even more embellishment."

Unlike European muskets, however, the jazayer was loaded using a horn rather than a paper cartridge meaning although the jazayer had the advantages of range, the force of impact, and accuracy, it took longer to reload than the standard European muskets of the era. One of the earliest recordings of Persian soldiers using jazayers in combat dates back to the mid-seventeenth century."

The size of this cavalry body fluctuated with time but at one point it was reported as 70,000 strong. Elements within the Savaran-e Sepah-e Khorasan were occasionally promoted by Nader to the Savaran-e Saltanati. The Savaran-e Sepah-e Khorasan played a decisive role in the final phase of the battle of Kars in which they participated in a huge flank attack, (40,000 strong), which Nader led personally."

The Tofangchi was the regular corps of musketeers, while the Jazayerchi were the elite gunners of Nader's personal army. During his reign, the importance of infantry began to be realized in Persian Armies, whereas they previously were second to the cavalry. Jazayerchi units engaged in training for several hours every day. A clear emphasis was given to the constant drilling of the soldiers. Nader shaped the jazayerchi corps himself and often took personal command of them in battle. According to another contemporary, the jazayerchi were well-uniformed and provided with the best equipment. Although the Jazayerchi was an infantry corps they usually campaigned on mounts and occasionally fought as mounted troops also. They were used to achieve the hardest and most crucial tactical tasks due to their high quality as elite fighting troops, proving their worth in many battles including Mihmandust, Murche-Khort, Kirkuk, Yeghevard, Karnal and Kars."

Catholicism seemed too friendly to the Danish, as seen by the actions of Gustav Trolle, and the seizure of church land increasingly swayed Sweden to Protestantism. The struggle saw development into the idea of Swedishness, and allowed peasants, who were already well represented, to learn and read the bible."

In 1634 the first Instrument of Government, engineered by Axel Oxensternia, is seen as Sweden's first collection of national laws, and the constitution would come in the following centuries.

The military often used aggressive shock tactics, contrasting the increasingly stationary and musket-based armies of continental Europe. It developed during the Carolean period and saw numerous successes in the thirty years' war, partly due to the Finnish Hakkapeliitta, and the Northern Wars, particularly Narva. Due to the strict discipline of Sweden's small army, the Gå-På worked well, and Sweden's soldiers were the bane of anyone who crossed them."

Recruitment took place through discharge ordered by the king. All common men between the ages of 15 and 50 were gathered at the place of discharge in each district. Meanwhile, the New system happened after the Skanian war and used rotations to ensure that men were always ready for the army. Each province was required to provide 1,200 men for the army. This was maintained by constant reductions that increased the land available to the state."
 hie_swe_caroleans: "Caroleans"
 hie_swe_caroleans_desc: "Sweden is small and does not have resources like France or Russia. Thus the army needs to innovate. Good discipline is vital for the Carolean's highly aggressive tactics, which required them to keep in formation and hold their fire as they approached the enemy, even if coming under a hail of bullets themselves. Carolean fight not just for the king, but for god itself, as they believe they are crusading against heretics and heathens. In fact, fatalism is induced to ensure soldiers have no fear, since if God wanted them to survive then nothing could harm them, and conversely if He had decreed that they were to die then death would come even if they tried to flee. On a more practical level, the army enforced draconian codes of discipline in order to encourage immediate and unthinking obedience among the men."

In Finland the peasants formed one of the four estates and were represented in the parliament. Outside the political sphere, however, the peasants were considered at the bottom of the social order—just above vagabonds. Still, many peasants had relatively good lives compared to the rest of Europe, and the peasants were not passive either.
