 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME1: "[Root.GetAdjective] Eclipse"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC1: "History treasures many tales of entire Civilizations vanishing into nothingness, leaving after themselves emerging states, convictions and peoples. While more successful and efficient governments proved to last longer than others, even they have eventually succumbed to corroding touch of time. A country can be subjugated and forced to serve, but one that crumbles from within - rarely, if ever, finds united strength and conviction for rebirth. An idea of a country may be attempted to be preserved, through cultural, political or at the very least - linguistic imitation of a Civilization that once was. Efforts ultimately futile as one cannot enter the same river twice.\n\n[Root.GetName] experienced a glorious era of military dominance, economic prosperity and arguably superiority of conviction. An age that is soon to be replaced by one constituting of struggle, violence and loss of entire generations."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA1: "We will endure."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB1: "[Root.GetName] in ruins!"
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME100: "Aftermath"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC100: "For years the [Root.GetName] have struggled to maintain their power and former glory. For years the [Root.GetAdjective] have been engulfed in conflict, strife and devastation. For years [Root.GetName] was on the verge of collapse. Our proud state still stands and we remember well those that would want to see otherwise. We remember what once was and what could be. And now, our soldiers look up to their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in hopes that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] will one day restore the might of [Root.GetName]!"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA100: "Endure. In enduring, grow stronger."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB100: "This is not over..."
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME2: "Religious Strife"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC2: "[eclipse_religious_province.Religion.GetName] communities living within [Root.GetName] continue to emerge bearing fire and sword. [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, despite our efforts, is no longer tolerated and heretics and heathens alike continue the attacks on [Root.GetAdjective] clergy and everyone who they find astray."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA2: "We cannot escalate the sitaution."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB2: "Reign them in."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTC2: "I profoundly do not care."
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME3: "Small people, Great hate"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC3: "[eclipse_cultural_province.Culture.GetName] community of [eclipse_cultural_province.GetName], inspired by the ideas of self-determination and dreams of their sovereignity have consolidated together to resist the oppressive rule of [Root.GetName]."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA3: "Give concessions."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB3: "Every [eclipse_cultural_province.Culture.GetName] will know their place!"
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME4: "The conspiracy"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC4: "Hardships the [Root.GetName] endures have not gone unnoticed by ambitious and discontent. As the crisis continues, few that still have trust in their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] have come to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to warn [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] about ongoing plot - estates have secretly conspired together to overthrow the [Root.Monarch.GetName] and seize portion of power and influence for themselves!"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA4: "Arrest and execute all we cannot trust!"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB4: "Surely these are but malign rumors?"
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME5: "Paralyzing Corruption"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC5: "Rotten to the core - that is the description both our citizens and foreigners apply to our state and bureaucracy. They speak of bribery, nepotism and favoritism - characteristics that have completely removed the last hope of meritocracy. During the dark age of Empires, corruption was perhaps the decisive nail in the coffin of a Civilization."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA5: "As long as I get my share, I do not care."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB5: "We have to do something."
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME6: "Army Betrayal"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC6: "Disbelief of future and loyalty to their generals, instead of their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], has resulted in Mass desertion. There are recorded instances of charismatic leaders convincing those subordinate to them to drop the [Root.GetAdjective] flag and fight for other causes - either for foreign powers, religious conviction or, at the very least, coin. From small incidents to entire regiments vanishing, numbers of our military is diminishing with each passing month. Whether we let disloyal elements go or force them to serve, one thing is clear - [Root.GetAdjective] army is in abysmal state."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA6: "One way or another, they WILL die for [Root.GetName]."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB6: "We do not need cowards."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTC6: "Execute those putting notion of disloyalty in our troops!"
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME7: "Enemy Within"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC7: "Sabotage, assassinations and other foreign interference - [Root.GetName] is riddled with spies like a wild dog with fleas. Nobody can be fully trusted, anybody can be a foreign agent and somebody is plotting against our great [Root.GovernmentName] at this very moment. These spies must be hunted down and erradicated, no matter the cost! While fruitful, such approach will cause severe consequences. We can, on the other hand, inefficiently, but quietly look out for these elements whenever and wherever possible and not displaying open distrust for those within government. Regardless, current weakness will be greatly exploited by our enemies, including [eclipse_spy_country.GetName]."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA7: "Clasp in irons all untrustworthy elements."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB7: "Exercise caution - we cannot afford more turmoil."
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME8: "Failed State?"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC8: "Unprecedented crisis [Root.GetName] experiences is being meticulously observed by foreign powers - both enemies and allies. Many who used to send envoys, bearing soft words and softer gifts, have ceased their operations to [Root.GetName]. Letters exchanged between [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and other rulers have changed in nature, constituting of colder, crisper langauge, instead of expected respectful and forthcoming words. Even [eclipse_ally_country.GetAdjective] diplomats have shown, through their words and actions, disbelief in fruitful cooperation and lack of interest in supporting [Root.GetName]. It would seem that the foreign powers are expecting our proud state to collapse any moment now..."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA8: "Let them think whatever they want."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB8: "We must try and alleviate our status!"
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME9: "City Conflict"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC9: "[eclipse_cityconflict_province.GetCapitalName] is in flames! Those dissatisfied with their lot in life have risen up and laid waste to their city and the rest of [eclipse_cityconflict_province.GetName]. As if this will help them in any way! Regardless, we can try and contain the conflict within the city or send in the army to put all the rebels to the sword."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA9: "Let them fight it out."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB9: "Restore order."
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME10: "Fall of [Root.GetName]"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC10: "[Root.GetName] the Great - now only in name. We have fallen far since our initial rise as a major player on the World's stage. Many believe that this is the end of our great civilization and it is time we stepped back and gave way to other emerging Empires. Our enemies, namely the [eclipse_rivalsubjugator_country.GetAdjective], are undoubtedly preparing for putting an end to our rule and force us under their yoke."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA10: "As long as [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] stands, we will endure."
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME14: "'Freedom to [eclipse_independence_country.GetAdjective] and other opressed peoples!'"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC14: "Rarely a state emerges from nothing - more often it forms out of decaying remains of a once mighty civilization. [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] is crumbling and our subjects see this as opportunity to declare independence. Treacherous [eclipse_independence_country.GetAdjective] are rallying up their troops, denouncing their benevolent overlord and executing [Root.GetAdjective] loyalists. Unimaginable insolence, but we nevertheless should consider one of two options - we cling to our malign subjects or give them the freedom they so crave... for now."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA14: "All of you - know your place!"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB14: "Take as much sovereignity as you want..."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTC14: "Perhaps the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can find a solution..."
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME15: "Rise of extremist practices in [eclipse_extremist_province.GetName]"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC15: "A new religious sect has emerged propagating adherence to holy scripture and practicing beliefs that topple the order of our proud [Root.GovernmentName]. These followers of a charismatic preacher have come to denounce our interpretation of holy text and brand all [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful as heretics. Originating in [eclipse_extremist_province.GetName] and, if rumors are true, sponsored by [eclipse_extremistrival_country.GetAdjective], these newborn fundamentalists are now spreading throughout the [Root.GovernmentName]. Among their poisonous thought they promote malign actions, such as religious violence and even call for execution of their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for his 'impiousness'!"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA15: "Remove this rot from our [Root.GovernmentName]!"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB15: "Surely we are not taking them seriously..."
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME16: "Advisors flee!"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC16: "Like rats escaping a sinking ship, our advisors in a hectic manner gather their belongings and areabout to flee the [Root.GovernmentName]. Not seeing the future here, within [Root.GetName], they seek a more stable and peaceful country to lend their services to."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA16: "[Root.GetAdjective] court has no place for cowards..."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB16: "Coin will convince them to stay."
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME17: "Lenders disillusioned"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC17: "Our [Root.GovernmentName] is heavily relient on foreign money. We are funding our bureaucracy and military with loans and like an avalanche, their number has increased in a worrisome manner. Some have come to an agreement that the deep crisis [Root.GetName] finds itself in will not bring their money back and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not eager to depart with his coffers. Believing there is no other way to gain their money and interest back, they have come to an agreement with [eclipse_loanfight_country.GetName] by funding them during the War in hopes they will at least recover a portion of their losses through War."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA17: "They resort to pillage now?"
 
 eclipse_great_power.EVTNAME18: "Lost Tolerance"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTDESC18: "In times of crisis, internal violence sprungs out within the state. Old grudges are once more being remembered, while the blame for the loss of fortune is being redirected to other groups. From individual Witch Hunts to massacre of religious minorities, idea of mutual respect and coexistence is becoming more alien to our population. The [Root.GetAdjective] have kept the policy of tolerance and harmony for years, but times are changing - perhaps we embrace a new course, distant from our current policy of forbearance?"
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTA18: "It is for the best."
 eclipse_great_power.EVTOPTB18: "We cannot let this crisis redefine us."
